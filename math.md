## Articles

I am slowly trying to wrap my head around the deeper parts of Exterior Algebra, which I think is still more important than people give it credit for. So far I've got:

{:class="bare"}
* [0. Oriented Areas and the Shoelace Formula]({% post_url 2018-08-06-oriented-area %})
* [1. Matrices and Determinants]({% post_url 2018-10-08-exterior-1 %})
* [2. The Inner product]({% post_url 2018-10-09-exterior-2 %})
* [3. The Hodge Star]({% post_url 2019-01-26-exterior-3 %})
* [4. The Interior Product]({% post_url 2019-01-27-exterior-4 %})
* [5. EA as Linearized Set Theory?]({% post_url 2019-02-13-exterior-5 %})
* [6. Oriented Projective Geometry]({% post_url 2019-02-23-exterior-6 %})

* [8. All the Exterior Algebra Operations]({% post_url 2020-10-15-ea-operations %})

I'm also playing around with the weird calculus of delta functions, pseudoinverses, and dividing by zero.

{:class="bare"}

* [Notations for Vector Division]({% post_url 2024-09-11-vector-division %})

I'm also slowly working through my undergraduate math and physics curriculum and trying to "compress" it in a way that makes sense to me. This is because I want to learn QFT to understand how the universe works, but getting through the math hurts my brain. I think the foundations can be made a lot simpler and then it would be easier.

{:class="bare"}

Every once in a while I write other miscellaneous math-related musings.

## Articles

I am slowly trying to wrap my head around the deeper parts of Exterior Algebra, which I think is still more important than people give it credit for. So far I've got:

{:class="bare"}
* [0. Oriented Areas and the Shoelace Formula]({% post_url 2018-08-06-oriented-area %})
* [1. Matrices and Determinants]({% post_url 2018-10-08-exterior-1 %})
* [2. The Inner product]({% post_url 2018-10-09-exterior-2 %})
* [3. The Hodge Star]({% post_url 2019-01-26-exterior-3 %})
* [4. The Interior Product]({% post_url 2019-01-27-exterior-4 %})
* [5. EA as Linearized Set Theory?]({% post_url 2019-02-13-exterior-5 %})
* [6. Oriented Projective Geometry]({% post_url 2019-02-23-exterior-6 %})
* [7. Simplex Volumes and Boundaries]({% post_url 2019-03-02-exterior-7 %})
* [8. All the Exterior Algebra Operations]({% post_url 2020-10-15-ea-operations %})

I'm also playing around with the weird calculus of delta functions, pseudoinverses, and dividing by zero.

* [Weird Takes on Angles]({% post_url 2025-03-21-angles %})

I'm also down a rabbit hole trying to make sense of fractional permutations and the identity $$(-\frac{1}{2})! = \sqrt{\pi}$$.

{:class="bare"}

* [Locating the Lemniscate]({% post_url 2025-11-03-gamma %})

I'm slowly working through my undergraduate math and physics curriculum and trying to "compress" it in a way that makes sense to me. This is because I want to learn QFT to understand how the universe works, but getting through the math hurts my brain. I think the foundations can be made a lot simpler and then it would be easier.

{:class="bare"}
* [Some Intuition For Entropy]({% post_url 2018-02-23-entropy-1 %})
* [Geometric Mean and Standard Deviation]({% post_url 2018-06-15-geometric-mean %})

* [The Essence of Complex Analysis]({% post_url 2020-08-10-complex-analysis %})
* [The Essence of Quantum Mechanics]({% post_url 2020-07-24-qm %})

And every once in a while I write other miscellaneous math-related musings.

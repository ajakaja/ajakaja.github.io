### about me:

I used to live in Seattle and worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. But I keep quitting jobs. At the moment I'm living in Durham, North Carolina.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be embarrasingly wrong that way.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd be delighted to hear from you. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. 

### about this:

I'm interested in a lot of things, but somewhat more nervous about talking about them online and under my real name, so mostly I've been writing about math. Math is interesting, though, so that's okay. Recently I've been trying to write about some other stuff as well. 

Someday I hope to write a novel, perform a concerto, make a programming language, release a video game, sell a painting, publish a paper, and visit every US National Park. So far I've been to about half of the parks and haven't really started on the rest of the list. So that's where I'm at.

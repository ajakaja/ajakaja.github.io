### about me:

I used to live in Seattle and worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. I wasn't especially happy to work at either but there were good parts too. Instead of buying a big million dollar Seattle house like you're supposed to I keep quitting and doing a lot of road trips instead. At the moment I'm living in Durham, North Carolina, which is where I went to college a decade ago, because I got too depressed during Covid in Seattle to stay.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be embarrasingly wrong that way.

### about this:

I think you will agree that everything in the world is a bit broken and confusing. This blog is a small and uncredentialed attempt at contributing, mostly by trying to make math and physics less confusing for me and then publishing the results so that it has some hope of scaling. I'd love to work on correcting broken-and-confusingness for the rest of life also, but it's somewhat nerve-wracking to put your strong opinions about other subjects on the internet, so this will have to do for now.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd really love that. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>.

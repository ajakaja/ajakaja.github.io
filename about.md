### about this:

Hi, I'm Alex. I like to write articles about math and physics and sometimes programming. I started doing this because it's the only way I can remember anything: I need to convert things into a form I find intuitive to understand it, and I need to write the intuitions down to remember them later. These articles are mostly things I wish I had come across myself so that I would not have had to study them for so long, so I've put them online in case anyone else is looking for the same thing.

I am not a mathematician or physicist, just a guy who likes math. Please double-check anything I write instead of believing it. My brain seems to only be able to do things intuitively, not rigorously, so I put these things up and just hope they're right. 

I know that's kind of silly, and I'm kinda embarrassed about it. But I figure, there's nothing wrong with trying to find better explanations for things, and if it all seems dangerously unrigorous or confused or just wrong, sorry, I did my best. But please do let me know so I can fix it up.

### About me:

I live in Durham, North Carolina. I used to live in Seattle, where I worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. I wasn't especially happy at either but there were good parts too. But during Covid Seattle got too depressing so I left and moved back near home. For the time being I guess my hobby is writing essays about math.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd appreciate it. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. I also have a Twitter account that I don't really use but feel free to message me there also: [@ajkish](https://twitter.com/ajkish).

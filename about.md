### about me:

I used to live in Seattle and worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. But I keep quitting jobs. At the moment I'm living in Durham, North Carolina.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be embarrasingly wrong that way.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd be delighted to hear from you. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. 

### about this:

Everything feels a little bit broken and confusing. I'm idly interested in any work towards correcting that, and this blog is my small attempt at contributing. So far I have mostly been writing about math because having strong opinions about math is less nerve-wracking that having strong opinions about other subjects. I'm slowly trying to branch out into other subjects, though.

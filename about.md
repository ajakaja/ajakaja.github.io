### about me:

Hi, I'm Alex. I live in North Carolina at the moment, and like to write articles about math and physics and sometimes programming. I started doing this because everything seems too confusing and opaque and none of the technical arguments stick in my mind, but clean intuition does. So I learn things and then try to write them out as pure intuition with no proofs and then I can hold onto it. 

I used to live in Seattle, where I worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. I wasn't especially happy at either but there were good parts too. Instead of saving up for a million dollar Seattle house like you're supposed to, I quit and went on a lot of road trips instead. Seattle got too depressing during Covid so I left and moved back near home. For the time being I guess my hobby is writing essays about math.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I know it's kind of silly. I figure, there's a place in the world for people trying to find better explanations for things, and if it all seems dangerously unrigorous or confused or just wrong, sorry. Do let me know though so I can fix it up.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd appreicate it. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. I also have a Twitter account that I don't really use but feel free to message me there also: [@ajkish](https://twitter.com/ajkish).

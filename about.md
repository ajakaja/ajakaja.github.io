Hi, I like to write articles about math and physics on the internet.

Most of what's on here is my own weird perspectives on standard material that you probably won't find anywhere else. I write these because I find a lot of standard material to be philosophically unsatisfying, and I accumulate these big piles of half-baked thoughts and speculations as I'm learning them. They were driving me crazy until I started writing them down in a public place. I don't know why it helps, but it does. Even though it's kind of embarrassing at the same time. 

Everything I write here could easily be wrong---I am not a professional mathematician or physicist, I'm just a guy who likes math, and my brain seems to be only able to do things intuitively, not rigorously. So please take anything you read on here with a grain of salt. If something seems dangerously unrigorous or confused or just wrong, sorry, I did my best. But please do let me know so I can fix it up also.

**About me:**

I'm Alex. I live in Durham, North Carolina. I used to live in Seattle, where I worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. I wasn't especially happy at either because it wasn't what I wanted to be doing, but there were good parts too. During Covid it got too depressing to be in Seattle so I left and moved back near home. For the time being I guess my hobby is writing essays about math.

If for some reason you want to contact me, please do, I'd appreciate it. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. I also have a Twitter account that I don't really use but feel free to do things there also: [@ajkish](https://twitter.com/ajkish).

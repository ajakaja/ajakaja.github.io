## about this:

I'm interested in a lot of things, but somewhat more nervous about talking about them online and under my real name, so mostly I've been writing about math.

## about me:

I live in Seattle, for now, and should probably get a job. Anyone want a software engineer?

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be wildly wrong about that.

If for some reason you want to contact me, go for it; I'd be delighted. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>

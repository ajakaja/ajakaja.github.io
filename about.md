## about this:

I'm interested in a lot of things, but somewhat more nervous about talking about them online and under my real name, so mostly I've been writing about math. Math is interesting, though, so that's okay.

## about me:

I used to live in Seattle and worked as a software engineer at Amazon and Dropbox. But I keep quitting jobs. At  the moment I live in North Carolina and am trying to figure out what to do with myself.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am definitely not credible at all, please don't look at me like that. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be wildly wrong that way.

If for some reason you want to contact me, go for it. I'm at <alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com>. I'd be delighted to hear from you.

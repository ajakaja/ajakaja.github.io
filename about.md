## about this:

I'm mostly motivated to write about math. I'm interested in a lot of things, but somewhat more nervous about talking about them online and under my real name, so math it is.

I'm not totally serious about the complex number thing. But what keeps me up at night is a desire to go back through math I was supposed to have mastered in college and make it all _make more sense_. Not by studying it more but by -- rephrasing, refactoring, and changing perspectives, I guess.

Besides math I am interested in math education, physics, music, writing software, games, literature, art and philosophizing. But it's easiest to write about math without getting self-conscious.

I thought the green triangle looked cool. Now I'm not so sure. But perhaps a few more splashes of color would not hurt, either.

## about me:

I live in Seattle, for now, and should probably get a job again.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am not credible. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be wildly wrong about that.

If for some reason you want to contact me -- go for it, I'd be delighted. I'm at alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com.

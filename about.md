## about this:

Apparently I'm mostly motivated to write about math.

I'm not totally serious about the complex number thing. But recently all I've wanted to do is go back through parts of math and physics that I'm supposed to have learned and make them... make more sense, I guess. That's what keeps me up at night. To each their own, ok?

Besides that I am interested in math education and writing software and designing games and philosophizing but it seems to be easier to write about math in public without getting self-conscious.

I thought the green triangle looked cool. Probably a few more splashes of color would not hurt either.

## about me:

I live in Seattle, for now, and should probably get a job again soon. And someday go to grad school.

I am not trained enough as a mathematician or physicist to be credible, so take everything on here with a grain of salt. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be wildly wrong about that.

If for some reason you want to contact me I can be reached at alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com.

## about this:

I've mostly been writing about math. I'm interested in a lot of things, but somewhat more nervous about talking about them online and under my real name, so math it is.

I'm not totally serious about the complex number thing. But what keeps me up at night is a desire to go back through math I was supposed to have mastered in college and make it all _make more sense_. Not by studying it more but by rephrasing, refactoring, and changing perspectives, I guess.

## about me:

I live in Seattle, for now, and should probably get a job.

I am not a mathematician or physicist and am not credible. I try to stick with "explaining things better than Wikipedia does" because it's harder to be wildly wrong about that.

If for some reason you want to contact me -- go for it, I'd be delighted. I'm at alex.kritchevsky@gmail.com.

Hi there,

<p>
My name is Alex. This is my blog.

<p>

I anticipate writing down:
<ul>
<li>Opinions on things</li>
<li>Somewhat original research / summarizing articles on math, computer science, physics, etc</li>
<li>Caches and outlines of subjects I've learned</li>
<li>Things I've figured out that might be useful to other people</li>
<li>Links to things I've worked on</li>
</ul>

Though who can say really.

Here's what I know about QM. I'm trying to learn QFT and it helps to have this stuff compressed into the simplest possible representation.

Conventions: $$c = 1$$, $$g_{\mu \nu} = diag(+, -, -, -)$$.

## 1. QM but starting from the solutions

QM makes a lot more sense when you (a) handle everything relativistically from the start and (b) just assume the form of the wave function solutions instead of deriving it. If I had my way I'd start a quantum mechanics course with special relativity, followed by introducing the scalar wave function, like this:


Consider a function on spacetime with the form $$\psi(t, \vec{x}) = e^{ i S(t, \vec{x})/\hbar}$$ which assigns a complex phase to every point in space. It is fully determined by a continuous function, the **action** $$S(\vec{x}, t)$$, and in particular given an initial state $$\psi_0$$, is determined by the 4-gradient of the action $$dS$$, via $$\psi(t, \vec{x}) = e^{i/\hbar \int dS} \psi_0$$.

Later on when potentials are involved we will need to be specific about the path of integration, but for now we can think of $$S$$ as a scalar function of spacetime.

Relativistic invariance insists that $$\psi$$ have the same value in any reference frame, and $$i \hbar \p \psi = i \hbar (\psi_t, - \psi_{\vec{x}}) = (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}}) \psi $$ must be a Lorentz 4-vector. Multiply on the left by $$\bar{\psi}$$ extracts the vector components: $$\< \psi \| i \hbar \p \| \psi \> = (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}})$$. Finally, $$\| (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}}) \| = \sqrt{ S_t^2 - S_{\vec{x}}^2 } $$ must be a Lorentz-invariant scalar.

You'll recognize that $$i \hbar \p_t = \hat{E}$$ and $$i \hbar \p_x = \hat{P}$$, the **energy** and **momentum** operators. The quantum mechanical operators extract _properties_ of $$S$$, but because $$S$$ is packed inside an exponential, they extract them as eigenvalues: $$ i \hbar \p_t \psi = S_t \psi$$. Our quantum-mechanical inner-product plus our operators then are just _tools for extracting properties of $$S$$_, since $$\psi$$ is the only thing we can directly operate on.

None of this requires that $$\psi$$ correspond to any concept in nature; it just concerns the properties of _any_ Lorentz-invariant function with the form $$e^{i / \hbar S(t, \vec{x})}$$ in spacetime. 

Of course we know that we'll find out experimentally that the (Fourier modes of the) free electron wave function (ignoring spin) actually does have this form. When an initial state is not a pure Fourier mode, then the initial state is a sum of Fourier modes of the initial measurement (for instance, if at $$t=0$$ we measure an electron at $$\vec{x} = 0$$, then the initial state is $$\psi(0, \vec{x}) = \delta(\vec{x}) = \int e^{i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{x}} d \vec{p}$$).

The exact values of $$\psi$$ (up to phase) and $$S$$ (up to a constant) are not be physically observable: we only ever see their derivatives. The exact value of $$\| \p S \|$$ is found to be the rest mass $$m$$.

## 2. Correspondences

Various concepts make a lot more sense when you take the form of the wave function as a starting point:

**Energy-momentum**: For a free particle $$S_t = E$$ and $$S_{\vec{x}} = \vec{p}$$, and $$m = \sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$$ is the relativistic rest energy/momentum relation. The wave function looks like $$\psi = e^{i/\hbar \int E dt - \vec{p} \cdot d\vec{x}} \psi_0$$. A high energy/momentum corresponds to a rapidly changing action, and thus to a wave function that is _quickly rotating_ as you translate in time or space.

**Path integration**: Relative changes in $$S$$ can be found by integrating: $$S(f) - S(i) = \int_{\gamma} dS$$ along any curve $$\gamma$$ from $$i$$ to $$f$$, and $$\psi(f) = e^{i/\hbar (S(f) - S(i))} \psi(i)$$. Thus $$e^{i/\hbar (S(f) - S(i))}  $$ is the 'transition matrix' between any two states, along a given path. The path integral formulation of QFT amounts to finding a way to compute this, integrating over all paths in state space between an initial and final state (including creation/annihilation of new particles). Integration along paths is necessary in practice because potentials are not necessary [exact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_and_exact_differential_forms), so $$dS$$ may not have an antiderivative.

**The roles of $$\hbar$$ and $$i$$**: $$S \mapsto e^{i / \hbar S}$$ is the conversion from 'action' space to 'phase' space. $$\hbar$$ changes units from action (energy * time) to radians; if we set $$\hbar = 1$$ we are declaring that we measure action in radians. The resulting space after mapping by $$e^{iS}$$ is physically meaningful, because in some cases we'll end up summing these phase factors from multiple starting states and seeing interference patterns. I suspect that the output space is the $$U(1)$$ that is identified with the electromagnetic gauge field but am not sure. If so, I think it would be good to write $$R_{EM}$$ instead of $$i$$, in order to avoid accidentally conflating the $$i$$ factors from rotations in different spaces. (Actually that's my stance on $$i$$ in general.)

**Angular momentum**: The orbital angular momentum operator, $$\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \p_{\phi}$$, does the same thing but for the wave function in spherical coordinates. Evidently the azimuthal angle term looks like $$\psi \sim e^{i/\hbar (E t - l_z \phi)}$$, and $$\hat{L}_z \psi = l_z \psi$$. $$l_z$$ measures how many times $$\psi$$ oscillates in a rotation of the polar angle $$\phi$$; it is quantized precisely because the $$\phi$$ coordinate has a built-in periodicity. A $$z$$-angular momentum value of $$l_z$$ labels the number of periods the wave makes as you rotate $$\phi$$ in the $$z$$-plane.


**Spin-$$\frac{1}{2}$$**: If $$l_z = 1/2$$, then $$\psi \sim e^{i/\hbar (Et - \phi / 2)}$$ is kinda like (the azimuthal component of) a $$z$$ spinor. This seems trivially unphysical, as the function appears to have different values at $$\phi = 0$$ vs $$\phi = 2 \pi$$. This is rectified by the fact that integration along paths _is_ necessary in general; the wave function is only used to _compare_ two states, and for spinor fields it's correct that $$\< \psi(\phi = 2 \pi) \| \psi(\phi = 0) \> = -1$$. Note: this is a useful illustration for a spinor-like object, but it's not literally a spinor, even if we include the $$r$$ and $$\theta$$ dependence, since it should have two components. We'll talk more about this later.

**Spin-$$1$$**: A vector-valued wave function $$\vec{\psi} = (\psi_x, \psi_y, \psi_z)$$, where the terms transform according to physical rotations, is a spin-1 object. To consider its angular momentum we diagonalize the $$L_z$$ operator by changing bases to $$(\psi_{+1}, \psi_0, \psi_{-1}) = (\psi_x - i \psi_y, \psi_z, \psi_x + i \psi_y)$$. These terms look like $$e^{i/\hbar (E t - l_z \phi)}$$ for $$l_z \in (+1, 0, -1)$$. The $$0$$ component of $$L_z$$ spin corresponds to a vector-valued wave function pointing only in the $$z$$ direction. $$\pm 1$$ components correspond to having $$x$$ or $$y$$ components, with the sign determined by their relative phase. Note what it means to have spin $$1$$: it's not that it fixes the _value_ of the angular momentum; rather, it specifies the different ways that the angular momentum can transform under rotation.

Photons are spin-1 particles, but their vector value cannot be a null vector so can never point in the direction of their motion (assume it's $$z$$) and so the $$l_z = 0$$ value is forbidden. The $$\pm 1$$ states correspond to photon polarizations.

**The Schrödinger Equation**: We can write $$ S_t^2 - S_x^2  = m^2$$ as $$S_t = \sqrt{m^2 + S_x^2} = m \sqrt{1 + \frac{S_x^2}{m^2}}$$ and expand as a Taylor series (note that $$\| S_x/m \| = \| p / m \| \ll 1$$) to get:

$$S_t = m (1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{S_x^2}{m^2} + O((\frac{S_x^2}{m^2})^2) \approx m + \frac{S_x^2}{2m}$$

Using our operator forms we get the free-particle Schrödinger equation:

$$\hat{E} \psi \approx (m + \hat{P}^2/2m) \psi$$ 

Interpreting, this says that the time-derivative of the action is a constant (the mass) plus a term proportional to the kinetic energy, plus higher-order terms that vanish at low momentums.

The $$m$$ term is normally ignored in non-relativistic QM. It corresponds to a constant change in phase along any path (and adds a constant term to the Lagrangian), but it drops out of any calculation if you (a) only integrate over time and (b) never create/annihilate particles.


**Schrödinger with potential**: The $$V$$ term in the non-relativistic Schrödinger ends up next to the kinetic energy term: $$\hat{E} \psi \approx (m + \hat{P}^2/2m + V) \psi$$. Working backwards through the derivation, we figure that the constraint on $$S$$ must be: $$S_t - V = \sqrt{m^2 + S_x^2}$$. But there is no particular reason this would have a clean relativistic form, since we treat our potential non-relativistically anyway.

Nevetheless we can add to our interpretation: the role of a classical scalar potential $$V$$ is to modify the phase change as a wave function translates in time, such that the particle acts like it has energy $$(E - V)$$ instead of $$E$$. The role of the vector potential is to modify the momentum, $$\vec{p} \mapsto \vec{p} - q \vec{A}$$.

The relativistic version uses the 4-potential $$A = (\phi, \vec{A})$$. The electromagnetic version is something like $$\psi = e^{i/\hbar \int [(E - q \phi) dt - (\vec{p} - q \vec{A}) \cdot d\vec{x} } = e^{i/\hbar \int (\p_{\mu} S - q A_{\mu}) dx^{\mu}}$$.  Interpreting: the potential serves to modify the contributions of energy and momentum by a path-dependent phase, by changing the action gradient as $$\p S \mapsto \p S - q A$$. A particle traversing a potential acts like it has a modified 4-momentum, of $$p \ra p - q A$$. Applying stationary-action to this Lagrangian gives the classical trajectory.

**The Lagrangian**: The integral $$\Delta S = \int dS$$ can be parameterized by time as 

$$\Delta S = \int (S_{\vec{x}} d\vec{x}/dt - S_t) dt  = \int_{\gamma} L \, dt$$

$$L = dS / dt$$ is the source of the (single-particle) Lagrangian, and is where the elementary form $$L = T - V$$ comes from. For a free particle, $$L dt = -m d\tau$$, and $$\Delta S = - \int m d \tau$$. In a classical scalar potential with $$S_t = E$$: 

$$L = S_{\vec{x}} \cdot d\vec{x}/dt - S_t = \vec{p} \cdot \vec{v} - E$$

In classical mechanics often $$E = T + V$$ and $$\vec{p} \cdot \vec{v} = 2 T$$, giving $$2 T - (T + V) = T - V$$.

**The Born Rule**: the probability of observing a state $$\alpha \| \psi \> $$ is proportional to $$\| \alpha \|^2$$. My pet theory is that this is due to destructive interference between histories of the observer. See my [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-22-many-worlds %}).

--------

To summarize:

1. QM makes a lot more sense if you just take as granted the fact that the wave function takes the form $$\psi = e^{i S/\hbar}$$.
2. Operators and inner products are ways of extract properties of $$S$$.
3. The Schrödinger equation for a free particle is a low-energy approximation of the statement that $$\| \p S \| = m$$.
4. The only free physical quantity in a wave function is the 4-vector $$\p S$$, which measures which part of the variation in $$S$$ is in the spatial vs timelike direction.
5. Intrinsic angular momentum is a property of what kind of object the wave function's value is (scalar, vector, spinor, etc).

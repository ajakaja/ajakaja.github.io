Here's what I know about QM. I'm trying to learn QFT and it helps to have this stuff compressed into the simplest possible representation.

Conventions: $$c = 1$$, $$g_{\mu \nu} = diag(+, -, -, -)$$.

## 1. QM but starting from the solutions

QM makes a lot more sense to me if you (a) handle everything relativistically from the start and (b) just assume the form of the wave function solutions instead of deriving it. If I had my way I'd start a quantum mechanics course with special relativity, followed by introducing the scalar wave function, like this:

Consider a function on spacetime with the form $$\psi(t, \vec{x}) = e^{ i S(t, \vec{x})/\hbar}$$ which assigns a complex phase to every point in space. It is fully determined by the **action** $$S(\vec{x}, t)$$, and in particular given an initial state $$\psi_0$$, is determined by the 4-gradient of the action $$dS$$, via $$\psi(t, \vec{x}) = e^{i/\hbar \int dS} \psi_0$$.

Later on when potentials are involved we will need to be specific about the path of integration, but for now we can think of $$S$$ as a scalar function that determines $$\psi$$ everywhere.

Relativistic invariance insists that $$\psi$$ have the same value in any reference frame, and $$i \hbar \p \psi = i \hbar (\psi_t, - \psi_{\vec{x}}) = (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}}) \psi $$ must be a Lorentz 4-vector. Multiply on the left by $$\bar{\psi}$$ extracts the vector components: $$\< \psi \| i \hbar \p \| \psi \> = (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}})$$. Finally, $$\| (- S_t, S_{\vec{x}}) \| = \sqrt{ S_t^2 - S_{\vec{x}}^2 } $$ must be a Lorentz-invariant scalar.

We recognize that $$i \hbar \p_t = \hat{E}$$ and $$i \hbar \p_x = \hat{P}$$, the **energy** and **momentum** operators. The quantum mechanical operators apparently extract properties of $$S$$, but because $$S$$ is packed inside an exponential, they extract them as eigenvalues: $$ i \hbar \p_t \psi = S_t \psi$$. Our quantum-mechanical inner-product plus our operators are just _tools for extracting properties of $$S$$_, since $$\psi$$ is the only thing we can directly operate on. The exact values of $$\psi$$ (up to phase) and $$S$$ (up to a constant) are not physically observable.

For a massive spinless particle the action gradient is $$dS = p$$, the four-momentum, with $$\| p \| = m$$, the rest mass. In the absence of a potential this gives the wave function: $$\psi = e^{i/\hbar \int p_\mu dx^\mu} = e^{i/\hbar p_\mu \D x^\mu} = e^{i/\hbar (Et - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{x})}$$, a Fourier mode with momentum $$p$$. Time evolution via exponentiation of the Hamiltonian amounts to translating in $$t$$:

$$\psi(t + \Delta t) = e^{i/\hbar \hat{H} \Delta t} \psi(t) = e^{- \Delta t  \p_t} \psi(t) = e^{i/\hbar (E(t - \Delta t) - \vec{p} \cdot \vec{x})}$$

When an initial state is not a pure Fourier mode, we expand it as a sum of Fourier modes. For instance, if at $$t=0$$ we measure an electron at $$\vec{x} = 0$$, then the initial state is $$\psi(0, \vec{x}) = \delta(\vec{x}) = \int e^{i \vec{p} \cdot \vec{x}} d \vec{p}$$.

When potentials are involved, $$dS$$ is modified. The electromagnetic field enters as $$dS = p - qA$$. Depending on the field configuration we may no longer be able to easily integrate $$\int dS$$: if $$A$$ includes a current, then it contains a 'line' of divergence, and the path integral's result will depend on how many times $$\gamma$$ circles this pole in spacetime. This causes the path integral to give _different_ values based on the choice of path; summing over these paths corresponds in QFT to summing over the number of photons that are exchanged (I think. Will work it out in detail later.)

## 2. Correspondences

Many concepts are not far away when you start with the solutions:

**Energy-momentum**: For a free particle $$S_t = E$$ and $$S_{\vec{x}} = \vec{p}$$, and $$m = \sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$$ is the relativistic rest energy/momentum relation. The wave function looks like $$\psi = e^{i/\hbar \int E dt - \vec{p} \cdot d\vec{x}} \psi_0$$. A high energy/momentum corresponds to a rapidly changing action, and thus to a wave function that is _quickly rotating_ as you translate in time or space.

**Path integration**: Relative changes in $$S$$ can be found by integrating: $$S(f) - S(i) = \int_{\gamma} dS$$ along any curve $$\gamma$$ from $$i$$ to $$f$$, and $$\psi(f) = e^{i/\hbar (S(f) - S(i))} \psi(i)$$. Thus $$e^{i/\hbar (S(f) - S(i))}  $$ is the 'transition matrix' between any two states, along a given path. The total transition amplitude is a sum over all possible paths between two states. This extends handily to QFT's path integrals when creation/annihilation of particles is included.

**The roles of $$\hbar$$ and $$i$$**: $$S \mapsto e^{i / \hbar S}$$ is the conversion from 'action' space to 'phase' space. $$\hbar$$ changes units from action (energy $$\times$$ time) to radians; if we set $$\hbar = 1$$ we are declaring that we measure action in radians. The resulting space after mapping by $$e^{iS}$$ is physically meaningful, because in some cases we'll end up summing these phase factors from multiple starting states and seeing interference patterns. I suspect that the output space is the $$U(1)$$ that is identified with the electromagnetic gauge field but am not sure. If so, I think it would be good to write $$R_{EM}$$ instead of $$i$$, in order to avoid accidentally conflating the $$i$$ factors from rotations in different spaces. (Actually that's my stance on $$i$$ in general.)

**Angular momentum**: The orbital angular momentum operator, $$\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \p_{\phi}$$, does the same thing as $$\hat{P} = i \hbar \p_{\vec{x}}$$ but for a wave function in spherical coordinates. The azimuthal angle term looks like $$\psi \sim e^{i/\hbar (E t - l_z \phi)}$$, and $$\hat{L}_z \psi = l_z \psi$$. $$l_z$$ measures how many times $$\psi$$ oscillates in a rotation of the polar angle $$\phi$$; it is quantized precisely because the $$\phi$$ coordinate has a built-in periodicity. A $$z$$-angular momentum value of $$l_z$$ labels the number of periods the wave makes as you rotate $$\phi$$ in the $$z$$-plane.


**Spin-$$\frac{1}{2}$$**: If $$l_z = 1/2$$, then $$\psi_{\pm} \sim e^{i/\hbar (Et - (\pm 1/2) \phi)}$$ acts like a spinor (by modeling the spin as orbital angular momentum, and omitting the $$r$$ and $$\theta$$ components). This function appears trivially unphysical, since it has different values at $$\phi = 0$$ vs $$\phi = 2 \pi$$. The resolution is the fact that it's only meaningful to use the wave function to _compare_ states that are connected by a path -- and for a spinor it's correct that $$\< \psi(\phi = 2 \pi) \| \psi(\phi = 0) \> = -1$$. (This is a useful mental model but isn't the fully story. An exhaustive exploration of spinors will be in a followup post.)

**Spin-$$1$$**: A _vector_-valued wave function $$\vec{\psi} = (\psi_x, \psi_y, \psi_z)$$, where the terms transform according to physical rotations, is a spin-1 object. To consider its angular momentum we diagonalize $$\hat{L}_z$$ by changing bases to $$(\psi_{+1}, \psi_0, \psi_{-1}) = (\psi_x + i \psi_y, \psi_z, \psi_x - i \psi_y)$$. These terms look like $$e^{i/\hbar (E t - l_z \phi)}$$ for $$l_z \in (+1, 0, -1)$$. The $$0$$ component of $$L_z$$ spin corresponds to a vector-valued wave function pointing only in the $$z$$ direction. $$\pm 1$$ components correspond to having $$x$$ or $$y$$ components, with the sign determined by their relative phase.

Note what it means to have spin $$1$$: it's not that it fixes the _value_ of the angular momentum; rather, it specifies the different ways that the angular momentum can transform under rotation. The three choices determine whether $$\vec{\psi}$$ is in the $$z$$ direction $$(l_z = 0)$$ or whether it has a positive or negative 'rotational' components in the $$xy$$ plane ($$l_z = \pm 1$$).

Photons are spin-1 particles, but their vector value cannot be a null vector so can never point in the direction of their motion (assume it's $$z$$) and so the $$l_z = 0$$ value is forbidden. The $$\pm 1$$ states correspond to photon polarizations.

**The Schrödinger Equation**: We can write $$ S_t^2 - S_x^2  = m^2$$ as $$S_t = \sqrt{m^2 + S_x^2} = m \sqrt{1 + \frac{S_x^2}{m^2}}$$ and expand as a Taylor series (note that $$\| S_x/m \| = \| p / m \| \ll 1$$) to get:

$$S_t = m (1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{S_x^2}{m^2} + O((\frac{S_x^2}{m^2})^2) \approx m + \frac{S_x^2}{2m}$$

Using our operator forms we get the free-particle Schrödinger equation:

$$\hat{E} \psi \approx (m + \hat{P}^2/2m) \psi$$ 

Interpreting, this says that the time-derivative of the action is a constant (the mass) plus a term proportional to the kinetic energy, plus higher-order terms that vanish at low momentums.

The $$m$$ term is normally ignored in non-relativistic QM. It corresponds to a constant change in phase along any path (and adds a constant term to the Lagrangian), but it drops out of any calculation if you (a) only integrate over time and (b) never create/annihilate particles.

**Schrödinger with potential**: The $$V$$ term in the non-relativistic Schrödinger ends up next to the kinetic energy term: $$\hat{E} \psi \approx (m + \hat{P}^2/2m + V) \psi$$. Working backwards through the derivation, we figure that the constraint on $$S$$ must be: $$S_t - V = \sqrt{m^2 + S_x^2}$$. But there is no particular reason this would have a clean relativistic form, since we treat our potential non-relativistically anyway.

Nevetheless we can add to our interpretation: the role of a classical scalar potential $$V$$ is to modify the phase change as a wave function translates in time, such that the particle acts like it has energy $$(E - V)$$ instead of $$E$$. The role of the vector potential is to modify the momentum, $$\vec{p} \mapsto \vec{p} - q \vec{A}$$.

The relativistic version uses the 4-potential $$A = (\phi, \vec{A})$$. The electromagnetic wave function is something like $$\psi = e^{i/\hbar \int [(E - q \phi) dt - (\vec{p} - q \vec{A}) \cdot d\vec{x} } = e^{i/\hbar \int (\p_{\mu} S - q A_{\mu}) dx^{\mu}}$$.  Interpreting: the potential serves to modify the contributions of energy and momentum by a path-dependent phase, by changing the action gradient as $$\p S \mapsto \p S - q A$$. A particle traversing a potential acts like it has a modified 4-momentum, of $$p \ra p - q A$$.



**The Lagrangian**: The integral $$\Delta S = \int dS$$ can be parameterized by time as 

$$\Delta S = \int (S_{\vec{x}} d\vec{x}/dt - S_t) dt  = \int_{\gamma} L \, dt$$

$$L = dS / dt$$ is the source of the (single-particle) Lagrangian, and is where the elementary form $$L = T - V$$ comes from. For a free particle, $$L dt = -m d\tau$$, and $$\Delta S = - \int m d \tau$$. In a classical scalar potential with $$S_t = E$$: 

$$L = S_{\vec{x}} \cdot d\vec{x}/dt - S_t = \vec{p} \cdot \vec{v} - E$$

In classical mechanics often $$E = T + V$$ and $$\vec{p} \cdot \vec{v} = 2 T$$, giving $$2 T - (T + V) = T - V$$.

Regardless of how we parameterize $$S = \int_{\gamma} dS$$, applying stationary-action will give the classical trajectory. Feynman's classic explanation of this is that all but the 'stationary' path -- the choice of $$\gamma$$ such that $$\delta S / \delta \gamma \vert_{\gamma} = 0$$ --  will exhibit destructive interference in the macroscopic limit, resulting in the laws of classical physics.

**Noether's Theorem**: Suppose there is some dynamical variable $$q$$ that $$S$$ depends on. Then we can locally approximate $$\Delta S = S(q, \ldots) + S_q \Delta q$$, adding a phase to the wave function $$\psi \ra e^{i/\hbar S_q \Delta q} \psi$$. This leaves physics unchanged if and only if $$S_q$$ is a constant, such that this is a uniform global phase transformation.

But if $$q$$ is a physical symmetry of the system, then it _must_ lead to the same physics; therefore $$S_q$$ is a constant throughout the system's evolution. $$S_q$$ is called the 'Noether charge' corresponding to the $$q$$ symmetry. $$E$$ is the charge associated with $$t$$; $$\vec{p}$$ for $$\vec{x}$$, $$\vec{L}$$ for $$\vec{\theta}$$, etc. (Presumably $$q = S_{\vec{A}}$$ but I'm not sure what that means yet.)

**Gauge transformations**:

Since physics is determined by an action integral like $$\int dS - q A_\mu dx^\mu$$, any integrable (exact) form added to $$A$$ and will only affect the action in a path-independent way:

$$\int_i^f dS - q(A_\mu dx^\mu + d \Lambda) = S_i^f  - q \Lambda_i^f - q \int A_\mu dx^\mu$$

This performs a gauge transform that doesn't affect the relative amplitudes of different paths between $$i \ra f$$ -- only the reuslting phase. As such there is no way to observe this effect in a closed system, so the addition of $$d \Lambda$$ is a free variable in the theory. However, it turns out to be important when considering interacting systems, in ways that I haven't learned yet but will be very important in QFT.

**The Born Rule**: The probability of observing a state $$\alpha \| \psi \> $$ is proportional to $$\| \alpha \|^2$$. My pet theory is that this is due to destructive interference between histories of the observer. See my [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-12-22-many-worlds %}).

## Summary

1. QM makes a lot more sense if you just take as granted the fact that the wave function takes the form $$\psi = e^{i S/\hbar}$$. 
2. Operators and inner products are ways of extract properties of $$S$$.
3. The Schrödinger equation for a free particle is a low-energy approximation of the statement that $$\| \p S \| = m$$.
4. The only free physical quantity in a wave function is the 4-vector $$\p S$$, which measures which part of the variation in $$S$$ is in the spatial vs timelike direction.
5. Potentials enter by modifying $$\p S$$, eg $$\p S \mapsto \p S - q A$$. $$\int_i^f dS = S(f) - S(i)$$ may no longer hold depending on the properties of $$A$$.
5. Intrinsic angular momentum is a property of what kind of object the wave function's value is (scalar, vector, spinor, etc).

Normally you have to unlearn QM to learn relativistic QM, but the relativistic version makes much more sense in the first place so why not start there?

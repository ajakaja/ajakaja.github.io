We've quit another job. Now there's more time for writing, which is to say more time for trudging in the direction of spiritual fulfillment via mathematical clarity.

The main project, which I woke up with one day, has been to stare at all the concepts which are near the same orbit as the wedge product $$\^$$ and hope that they will one day make sense. So far I have just assumed this is possible. The approach which briefly worked a few years ago -- the last time I was underemployed -- was to try only to prove known formulas using this strange algebra, a task which one can actually make and show progress on, in hopes that it would illuminate things. It did illuminate a few things, to me at least, I guess.

At the time I wrote many words (many more than I've uploaded here), most of which embarrass me now, and which I've come to doubt the accuracy of either way. I am unfortunately not a very good mathematician, at least when it comes to proofs and rigor and whatnot. I just very much like understanding stuff, and it didn't seem possible to keep understanding the physics I want to know without understanding this math first.

So that's where we're at. I need to remember what I was working on, and what any of it meant, and probably take a step back and put it all in context because it's already way too much to handle. There is no way that the Gods of Math intended or required this many silly operations, with this many negative signs, to say what they wished. These will be obsolete at the end, somehow. What are we missing?

The story so far: there is an algebra on basis vectors in a vector space which seems to bestow clarity on all kinds of otherwise opaque mathematics. We suspect it can be massaged to bestow much more clarity than it already does, but we're not sure how to do it. We are also fighting through decades of notational and conceptual baggage that makes it harder to see clearly.

The wedge product is very handy for unifying things In particular, a matrix on a vector space $$V$$ can operate on any of the basis multivectors as well; the components of its representation on the multivectors are given by its minors. The determinant $$\det M$$ is the action on the pseudoscalar space (e.g. $$\^^n \bb{R}^n$$).

Unfortunately the notation is a mistake: $$\^$$ should be written $$\v$$ for symmetry with lattice theory and boolean algebra, because is more of a 'union' $$\cup$$ than an 'intersection' $$\cap$$. Oh well.

Anyway there are [many more operations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-10-15-ea-operations %}) and they pretty much don't make a ton of sense together. Cartan and the physicists were probably right to discard everything except $$\^$$, $$\iota$$, and $$\star$$. It's really a mess.

I have a bunch of draft articles that summarize more stuff that was interesting, which I'd like to finish, but it really feels like there's some big thing hiding here in plain sight that I haven't been able to see yet. Why does it keep feeling like $$\b{x \v x}$$ should not equal $$0$$? Or that you should have negative wedge powers? Is that the same thing as vector space duality? And, is this just one among many types of non-commutative algebra, and the whole problem should really be solved in generality? Maybe that lets it involve exterior derivatives correctly. And what's the relationship to graded algebras and superalgebras? Why is geometric algebra so awkward, yet able to be associative, while these are not?

I hope to report on anything I discover towards those questions, but no promises. I'm not particulary good at this. Just rather dedicated, and newly in possession of a lot of free time.

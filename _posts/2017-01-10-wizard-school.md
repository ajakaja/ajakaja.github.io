I've been trying to start blogging for years, where the meaning of "try" is the one that's more like "wanting to, performing gestures in the direction of, and never following through" -- the Akrasiac's Try. 

Should anyone care what I have to say? Nah. I'm all talk so far. My hunch (capitalized? The Hunch?) is that I have a capacity to write something that someone will want to read, someday, but it's just *my* hunch; I know enough to know not to ask anyone to take me seriously unless I do something useful. The Hunch is good enough motivation for me but won't and shouldn't convince anyone else.

(If nothing else, I think I can explain math pretty lucidly. That's a contribution that someone might find useful.)

There's also a personal dilemma: how do you post candidly on a blog? I get more anxious about people I know reading what I write, much more than from strangers. My family causes a mysterious pressure to not stand out, not to 'seek' pride, not to be ostentatious. Acting mature is... embarrassing? I have to ignore those anxieties to even write using turns of phrase, much less profess any beliefs or act passionate. It might be described as a pressure to suppress *effusivity*. I wonder how common this is? It was a fairly recent revelation that this has to be put aside to get anything done.

#### Quick about-me

I had a comfortable tech job a while ago, quit it, and am now coasting on savings while ostensibly trying to, erm, self-actualize. Self-actualizing, whatever that means, hasn't happened yet, and that's probably fine but I do feel somewhat guilty about it. 

My initial plan after quitting was to buckle down for a month and start spitting out essays and flying through math textbooks, or something. But recently, not long after my one-year anniversary of not doing any of that, I realized that it might be better to write *anything* than think about learning everything and then writing about it later. Reports from the 'trenches', I guess (these being the trenches of self-study, self-motivation, and self-actualization): whatever I'm working on, thinking about, or learning. "Write what you know", that sort of thing. If what I have to talk about is going to be useful to someone else, it'll probably be useful without being carefully bundled into persuasive longform, especially if I don't know how to do that yet.

#### The point:

The path to self-actualization is probably something like becoming a wizard (see for reference your favorite coming-of-age fantasy novel). At least it's fun to imagine: certain figures worthy of admiration/emulation (Richard Feynman, Elon Musk?) are the modern wizards, in a sense of the word. The common theme is an ability to *cause things to happen with your mind*, be it understanding, creation, or mobilization. It doesn't come naturally to me, but it sounds like a fun thing to master.

So the lofty half-serious goal is to become a wizard. This metaphor is a thrill to overuse: sure, those two example wiards showed every sign of magical affinity from a young age, far more than I ever did. But that just means I'm shooting for the "brooding adult who learns the arts on his own in his basement lab out of dusty old tomes" archetype instead of the "Precocious Chosen One" archetype. So what if the former narrative is usually how dark wizards come about?

What does magic look like these days? View it in terms of the DnD magic schools: being able to wave your hands and conjure an app, a device, a work of art -- that's Conjuration, willing something into existence. To lead and drive, that's Evocation, the creation of energy from nothing. To learn and compute, and be able to understand anything -- Divination. To become strong, wise, and disciplined, resistant to setback -- Abjuration, your shields and protections. Persuasion and charisma have to correspond to the school Enchantment. Still looking for analogies for Illusion (deception?), Transmutation (engineering?), and Necromancy (er..).

I guess I'm training in Conjuration and Divination for now. I'm hoping to master Abjuration on the side, but you really can't force these things.

#### Something like a plan:

I am trying to convert my unemployed life into a structure where my daily time spent working should be comparable to having a job. Certainly that would give me plausible deniability and should lead to results I can show off afterwards. I haven't been working *at all*, really, to date, but I have learned a lot about how to work and shed a lot of destructive habits. I'm part of the way there.

They say accountability is the key. A friend suggested I put money on it: give her, say, six hundred dollars to escrow, which I won't see again until a task is done. She seemed too enthusiastic about getting the money, though.

I can do accountability a different way -- I can make public promises. But not yet; I'm not ready to commit to anything. (I had committed to something, but I regret it. I edited it out. It was stressful.)

I'm starting out with learning undergraduate maths that I never mastered -- complex and real analysis for starters. Then on to graduate math, beginning with abstract algebra. I mean to do physics and computer science subjects eventually but it will be useful to practice the most rigorous thing first, so that the rigor can be applied to everything else (my impression is that rigorous math skills are rarer among physicists than they should be, and that that is probably a weakness, and that it probably limits which fields you can do well in).

I'm interesting in 'really' learning subjects, to mastery, as opposed to enough-to-get-a-good-grade learning. There wasn't a single math or physics class in college (out of 20+?) that I actually mastered, between deficiencies in my discipline and time investments, and my bad style of learning.

Suffice to say, it seems like if you 'really-know' a subject you ought to be basically able write the textbook yourself. And if you really know a subject that involves a toolbox of computation skills, which (say) complex analysis definitely does, you ought to be extremely good at them. I've learned to do contour integrals at least five times in my life and I still wouldn't be sure if I was doing them right today -- but I'll never forget how to do u-substitution. Was intro calculus easier, or was I just learning things better in high school? I think it's the latter. More on that another day.

Long-term, I'm looking at getting a master's degree in math or physics next year, because I'm too noncommittal to go for a PhD and lock myself into one place. A masters in a foreign country also seems like a good way to travel. But I'd be interested in a researchy job as well, if an option turned up. Or if I run out of money I might go back to a tech company for a while.

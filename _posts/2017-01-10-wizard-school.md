I've been trying to start blogging for years, where the type of "try" in question is the one that's more like "wanting to, performing gestures in the direction of, and never following through": the Akrasiac's Try.

It's never been hard to have ideas that feel worth sharing. But it's never been easy to turn them into long-form writing. One problem: my favorite bloggers are producing well-crafted, seemingly important essays on a weekly basis -- so it feels like that's 'what the job is', even if I have no history of ever succeeding at that. Another problem: I've never learned to get anything done (painfully aware of this). I'm a middle class white guy who was good at math, stumbled forward into a tech job and a video game addiction (recently wrangled) without having to work very hard. One of millions.

And why should anyone care what I have say? No reason. The hunch (capitalized? The Hunch?) is that I have a capacity to say some stuff that could use saying, but it's only my hunch, possibly corroborated by one or two others, maybe. Certainly only provable by doing it; I'm all talk for now. The Hunch is good enough motivation for me but won't and shouldn't convince anyone else.

(If nothing else, I think I can explain some math and physics material with relative lucidity. That's a contribution that someone might find useful, someday.)

A dilemma: how to post candidly on a blog? The way my family dynamics work, I never want to project my personality into the world. There's a mysterious pressure -- nobody's fault -- not to stand out, never to dare earn pride, never to be ostentatious. To act mature is somehow embarrassing. I have to ignore that if I'm going to write using possibly-judgeable turns of phrase, much less profess any beliefs or reveal any passion or do anything vulnerable. I wonder if everyone feels this way and ignores it, or if it's pretty unique to us? I think the unusual magnitude of it is correlated with growing up with a twin. A recent revelation: that I have to put this aside to get anything done.

#### On Wizardry:

I had a comfortable tech job a while ago, quit it, and am now coasting on savings while ostensibly trying to, like, self-actualize. Very typically millennial. Self-actualizing -- whatever that means -- hasn't happened, and that's Fine (and I even believe that, most days). My initial plan after quitting was to buckle down for a month and start spitting out brilliant essays. I realized recently (not long after my one-year anniversary of (ahem) dicking around) that it might be better to do reports 'from the trenches' (these being the trenches of self-study, self-motivation, and self-actualization). Just write what you know, that sort of thing. If what I have to talk about is going to be useful to someone else, it'll probably be useful without being carefully bundled into persuasive longform. For now.

I imagine, quite vicariously, that the path to self-actualization is something like becoming a wizard (cf your favorite coming-of-age fantasy novel). Certain figures worthy of admiration (emulation) -- Richard Feynman and Elon Musk are my go-tos -- are something like wizards, in some modern sense of the word. This metaphor is a thrill to overuse. Sure, those two showed every sign of magical affinity from a young age, more than I ever did. But that just means I'm shooting for the "brooding adult who learns the arts on his own in his basement lab out of dusty old tomes" archetype instead of the "Precocious Chosen One". So what if the former narrative is usually how dark wizards come about?

(I do, and I'm not ashamed to admit it except a little bit, fantasize that if I can make it down the path to wizardry on volition alone, such a from-the-trenches record will be fascinating afterwards. Is it conceited to use that kind of imagining to motivate yourself? Yeah, probably. But it might be effective enough to allow. Or maybe it's precisely the kind of motivation that falls flat at the first sign of hardship. Unsure for now.)

What does magic look like these days? Being able to wave your hands and conjure an app, a device, a work of art -- that's Conjuration, willing something into existence. To lead and drive, that's Evocation, the creation of energy from nothing. To learn and compute, and be able to understand anything -- Divination. To become strong, wise, and disciplined, resistant to setback -- that's Abjuration, your shields and protections. Persuasion's gotta be Illusion, because Enchantment is charisma. I'm not sure what skills Transmutation or Necromancy correspond to, yet.

I'm training in Conjuration and Divination for now. I'm hoping to master Abjuration on the side, but you can't force these things.

#### Something like a plan:

Short term goal #1: get on track. Daily time spent training should be comparable to working a job. Enough goofing around.

I did a decent enough job of quitting video games a few months ago, but am still losing hours to the Reddit + Facebook death spiral, plus my current willpower vacuum of choice, Twitch streams.

Accountability is the key. A friend suggested I put money on it: give her, say, six hundred dollars for escrow, which I won't see again until a task is done. I think she was mostly enthusiastic to get the money, though.

I can do accountability a different way -- I can make public promises. Watch: **I'm going to start blogging every day, starting today.** Check out that "Day 1" in the title. How stressful is that?

A year of blog posts should be enough to create at least something worth sharing, plus motivate continuous work, plus get a lot of practice. Maybe make a few friends too. I have enough notes and drafts and ideas saved up for at least 90 days of hit-or-miss material, so the problem is the work, not the ideas.

Short-term goal #2: Learn the easiest math textbook in my pile of textbooks, which is an undergraduate-level complex analysis course. Learn it *for real*, not just working the problems the point of familiarity. Suffice to say, it seems like if you really know a subject you ought to be basically able write the textbook yourself.

And if you really know a subject that involves a toolbox of computation skills, which complex analysis definitely does, you ought to be extremely good at them. I've learned to do contour integrals ten times in my life and I still wouldn't be sure if I was doing them right today -- but I'll never forget how to do u-substitution. Was intro calculus easier, or was I just learning things better in high school?

I think it's the latter. More on that, another day.

**Long-term view**: keep on eye on a way to do a masters degree in physics, math, or CS. The structure and credentials would be useful. Don't overpay. Otherwise, another tech job should be  attainable. Bonus points if it can convert to being remote.

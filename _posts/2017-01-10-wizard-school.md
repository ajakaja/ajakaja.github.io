I've been trying to start blogging for years, where the type of "try" in question is the one that's more like "wanting to, performing gestures in the direction of, and never following through" -- the Akrasiac's Try.

It's been easy to have ideas that feel worth sharing (whether they actually are is a different matter), but always hard to turn them into long-form writing. One problem: the bloggers I read are producing well-crafted, seemingly important essays on a weekly basis -- so it feels like that's what the job is, despite my having no history of ever succeeding at that. Another problem: I've never actually learned to get anything done (painfully aware of this). I'm a middle class white guy who was good at math, stumbled forward into a tech job and a video game addiction (recently wrangled) without having to work very hard. One of many.

Should anyone care what I have say? Nah. The hunch (capitalized? The Hunch?) is that I have a capacity to write something that someone will want to read about someday, but it's only *my* hunch, possibly corroborated by one or two others. That's certainly only provable by doing it; I'm all talk for now. The Hunch is good enough motivation for me but won't and shouldn't convince anyone else.

(If nothing else, I think I can lucidly explain some math and physics material that's in need of better explanation. That's a contribution that someone might find useful.)

There's also a personal dilemma: how do you post candidly on a blog? I'm more anxious about people I know reading it than strangers. My family causes me a mysterious pressure -- nobody particular's fault -- not to stand out, not to seek to earn pride, never to be ostentatious. Acting mature is  embarrassing. I have to ignore that if I'm going to write using possibly-judgeable turns of phrase, much less profess any beliefs or act passionate or do anything vulnerable. I wonder if everyone feels this way and ignores it, or if it's pretty unique to me? It was a recent revelation that I have to put this aside to get anything done.

I had a comfortable tech job a while ago, quit it, and am now coasting on savings while ostensibly trying to, erm, self-actualize. Self-actualizing, whatever that means, hasn't happened, and that's 'fine'. My initial plan after quitting was to buckle down for a month and start spitting out brilliant essays, or something. Recently, not long after my one-year anniversary of... not doing that, I realized that it might be better to write in the manner of 'reports from the trenches' (these being the trenches of self-study, self-motivation, and self-actualization): whatever I'm working on, thinking about, or learning. "Write what you know", that sort of thing. If what I have to talk about is going to be useful to someone else, it'll probably be useful without being carefully bundled into persuasive longform, especially if I don't know how to do that. For now.

So we begin with: the point.

#### On Wizardry:

I like to imagine, quite vicariously, that the path to self-actualization is something like becoming a wizard (see for reference your favorite coming-of-age fantasy novel). Certain figures worthy of admiration/emulation -- Richard Feynman and Elon Musk are my go-to examples -- are wizards, in a modern sense of the word. So the goal is to become a wizard. This metaphor is a thrill to overuse. Sure, those two showed every sign of magical affinity from a young age, far more than I ever did. But that just means I'm shooting for the "brooding adult who learns the arts on his own in his basement lab out of dusty old tomes" archetype instead of the "Precocious Chosen One" archetype. So what if the former narrative is usually how dark wizards come about?

(If I do manage to study my way on to wizardry, maybe having these notes saved up from the path afterwards will be useful or interesting to someone.)

What does magic look like these days? View it in terms of the DnD magic schools: being able to wave your hands and conjure an app, a device, a work of art -- that's Conjuration, willing something into existence. To lead and drive, that's Evocation, the creation of energy from nothing. To learn and compute, and be able to understand anything -- Divination. To become strong, wise, and disciplined, resistant to setback -- that's Abjuration, your shields and protections. The art of persuasion has got to be Illusion so that Enchantment can be charisma. Still looking for analogies Transmutation and Necromancy.

So I guess I'm training in Conjuration and Divination for now. I'm hoping to master Abjuration on the side, but you can't force these things.

#### Something like a plan:

Short term goal #1: get on track. Daily time spent working should be comparable to working a job.

I did a decent enough job of quitting video games a few months ago, but am still losing hours to the Reddit + Facebook death spiral, plus my current willpower vacuum of choice, Twitch streams.

They say accountability is the key. A friend suggested I put money on it: give her, say, six hundred dollars for escrow, which I won't see again until a task is done. I think she was mostly enthusiastic to get the money, though.

I can do accountability a different way -- I can make public promises. Watch: **I'm going to start blogging every day, starting today.** Check out that "Day 1" in the title. How stressful is that?

A year of blog posts should be enough to create something worth sharing, plus motivate continuous work, plus get a lot of practice. Maybe make a few friends too. I have enough notes and drafts and ideas saved up for at least 90 days of hit-or-miss material, so the problem is the work, not the ideas.

Short-term goal #2: Learn the easiest math textbook in my pile of textbooks, which is an undergraduate-level complex analysis course. Learn it *for real*, not just working the problems the point of familiarity. 

(Suffice to say, it seems like if you really know a subject you ought to be basically able write the textbook yourself. And if you really know a subject that involves a toolbox of computation skills, which complex analysis definitely does, you ought to be extremely good at them. I've learned to do contour integrals at least five times in my life and I still wouldn't be sure if I was doing them right today -- but I'll never forget how to do u-substitution. Was intro calculus easier, or was I just learning things better in high school?

I think it's the latter. More on that, another day.)

**Long-term view**: keep on eye on a way to do a masters degree in physics, math, or CS. Still not sure which. The structure and credentials and connections would be useful. It would unlock (via 'having references' and 'making the resume less ignorable' and 'having professor friends for advice') a PhD as an option. Otherwise, another tech job should be attainable. Bonus points if it can convert to being remote -- being able to be nomadic has been a great comfort so far.

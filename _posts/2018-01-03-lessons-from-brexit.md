[This](https://dominiccummings.com/2017/01/09/on-the-referendum-21-branching-histories-of-the-2016-referendum-and-the-frogs-before-the-storm-2/) January 2017 post, by Dominic Cummings, the architect/manager of Brexit, on 'how it happened' and 'why no one understands how it happened', is the most insightful thing I read last year.

It is *so good*.

It is so good it makes me want to go comb through everything else on his blog for insights.

It is so good that, when I realized I couldn't remember why it was so good, I had to go reread it.

... It's also so *long* that by the time I finish it I can't remember half of the things I liked. And it, well, rambles incoherently sometimes, also. It's not perfect. So I'm going to actually write down in article form what its main insights are, to make them easier to re-access. That's what this is.

(It's also available with better UX [here](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/01/dominic-cummings-brexit-referendum-won/), but I figure it's most noble to link to the original source.)

(Admittedly, the author seems somewhat cold / calculating / psychopathic (and apparently the UK media loves to [call him that](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2017/jul/18/dominic-cummings-career-psychopath-david-davis-thick-as-mince)), so perhaps it's not best to aspire to think like him. But I'm praising him for his intellectual qualities, not his empathy. Maybe only the rest of us should focus on both.)

It's not that Cummings is *right*. I have no idea if he's right. I don't know anything about Brexit, and I definitely haven't read any critical responses to the piece that would put it in larger context. 

What I'm captivated by is how his article has this insight-porn 'rightness' quality to it, where I immediately find credible his ideas. So I'm both interested in "what he has to say" and "how it's so compelling".

The components of this quality of Right-Seeming-ness are:

1. The points themselves 'seem' correct, in that:
	* They explain things I didn't understand in a way that my brain logically and eagerly accepts.
	* They don't explain things that seem false ([prove too much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much))
		* [this, IMO, is the most sound technique 'identify bullshit without data'. Most false claims are obviously false because of what they imply -- what would be true if they were true -- rather than what they claim.]
2. The writer seems intellectual pure:
	* He seems concerned with reasoning clearly, more than social or political goals
		* He criticizes *models* of thought that lead to false claims, not just the claims themselves
	* He seems to think mathematically and rationally
		* He includes pseudo-confidence intervals ("they would have won (>95% confidence)") on some claims instead of asserting their truth
		* He recognizes and *signals recognizing* mathematical legitimacy in claims / models
		* He seem (dangerous...) not to be writing with a hidden agenda. Of course that could be faked, but:
			* He does socially abnormal things like specifically name-and-shaming people for their incompetence, which a polically manipulative person would... probably... not do?
			* He seems unconcerned with defending / praising himself, and eagerly describes his own failures and how people's praises of him are wrong. (Indeed, it seems very much like he doesn't care what anyone thinks of him and that he just doesn't want the world to be wrong without his having said something!)
		* He seems (again, dangerous) primarily concerned and motivated by truth-seeking and accurate modeling of the world
			* There are myriad things that would be different, I think, in his writing if he *wasn't*. So the negation of this ("he's concerned with something other htan truth-seeking...") would 'prove too much'.
	* He has clout. (Of course -- his people did win an election no one thought he would win, and his behavior is evidence he thought it was winnable when mostly no one else did. But we can't give that too much credit: he also condemns believing winners just because they won!)
3. Most importantly, he writes about *frameworks* that fit around his claims, which is much more powerful than just "claiming correct facts":
	* He provides models for understanding politics in which it's clear *why* his points are right., and
	* He provides models of how most people think that makes it clear *why they were wrong*
		So we come out feeling like we see not only "how things are" but also "why we couldn't see that before".

The result is set of ideas I find myself strongly *wanting to believe*: of what happened, why I didn't get it, why almost no one got it, what he did that people didn't predict, and why it worked. 

This is far more compelling than a series of facts that could be true or false. This is (I think) how all arguments for 'new models of reality' must be wrirten if they are to succeed. (And I suspect most people aren't capable of doing this successfully.)

It helps, also, that his models seem to either agree or expand, instead of refute, my own. So of course I like someone who seems to agree with me. Of course my model might be dead wrong also, but mutual corroboration means that we're probably right or wrong together. And I tend to think mine isn't, anyway, because that's more fun and more useful to me, and lets me spend less time plagued by existential self-doubt.

------------

So, it's the kind of writing that makes you feel abundantly smarter reading it, *and* it's an unusually lengthy example of that so it's got a lot of meat, *and* it's about politics which is already a frustratingly incomprehensible area, that's going through an especially incomprehensible phase.

My one concern in praising this article is: I don't really get *why* he wrote this. (reminder: it's not that it might all be fictional and I wouldn't be able to tell; that doesn't matter much.) What does he gains from trying to dispel ignorance around how Brexit went through or how the world works? Since I can't see his agenda, I feel like I'm lapping up his thoughts uncritically. 

Maybe it would be more obvious what Dominic's goals are if I was, well, British, or knew of his other work. Maybe he's actually pure-minded idealist who's trying to fix the world, decency be damned. Maybe he just relishes telling people they're wrong or in sounding smart. Not sure.

But -- I still think the insights in this article are compelling, even without the context of understanding his agenda.

So: here is an outline with commentary and important points highlighted. It's mostly for me, to help me remember what I liked in a briefer and more referenceable format. But you can read it too.

## A Massive Outline

(One # = One Paragraph)
(First person = Dominic Cummings, not me)
(Annotated with some context for Americans, when it matters, with what I could quickly figure out.)

### 1. Intro 

1. We won the Brexit referendum in amazingly little time (~1 year) despite everyone saying we shouldn't.
2. How? Books are being written...
3. And people want me to write about it. I was avoiding it because thinking about it made me sick, because
4. ... every waking moment of a year of my life was spent on it, mostly dealing with frustrating bullshit.
	* Most people on our side were useless and thought of *Vote Leave* as the enemy.
	* **Note**: *Vote Leave* was Dominic's campaign. There were others (*Leave.EU* being the main alternative), but *Vote Leave* was the most competent, was eventually selected as the 'official' campaign, and did most of the effective work.
5. SW1 is deranged.
	* **Note**: SW1 is the postal code for most of the UK government in London, and is used as a metonym for the whole government. It is like saying "Washington" in the US.
	* Politics reflects human nature: fear, self-interest, vanity.
	* "Delusions and vanity dominate ‘rationality’ and ‘public service’"
	* **Highlight**: "Progress, when it comes, is driven by the error-correcting institutions of science and markets..."
	* "It rarely comes from [leaders / decision makers], and, when it does, it is usually accidental or incidental to their motives."
		* **Comment**: This is also my model of the world. It is why I am not bothered by Trump so much as by the America that elected him.
			* However, I think there are a few more major forces in the '[psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional))' of the world. I'd estimate the world also changes most macroscopically on a few other key axes: Wisdom vs Reactionaryism, Humility vs Elitism, and Pragmatism vs Nihilism. These should factor in somehow.
			* Not to get sidetracked, but... I'm really interested in understanding the significant cogs in the, uh, global socioeconomic machine, based on the postule that change is almost always a gradual, 'tidal' effect, and policy changes / major events like Brexit / Trump / etc are just the easily trackable markers of those currents. 
			* And I think that science and market forces alone don't cover it, because there are other social / philosophical undercurrents that have led to change and progress, even in my lifetime, on their own -- currents which must be understood to answer questions like "why are Americans moving back to cities?" or "Why did Trump win?".
6. Questions like "Why did X win/lose" are misleading; people tend to make fallacious *post facto* stories.
7. **Highlight**: "I’ve learned over the years that ‘rational discussion’ accomplishes almost nothing in politics."" BUT, things you say or write can have subtle network effects that do good things later
8. Politics is not a field that meets the criteria for expertise
	* [From later] these are: 
		1. "there is enough informational structure in the environment such that reliable predictions are possible despite complexity"
		2.  there is effective feedback so learning is possible.
	* The opinions of people who win are taken too seriously (since they aren't experts either)
	* Dominic shows some humility ("It is more likely that I am wrong than 99% of people who work in this field professionally.")
		* **Comment**: but he still sounds more right than everyone else, because he's describing a framework in which it makes sense that everyone is clueless, and no one else is doing that.
	* For example, David Cameron won and thought he knew why and this made him make mistakes in the Brexit campaign
		* **note**: David Cameron = Prime Minster of UK; elected 2015, anti-Brexit. He resigned after losing the referendum, which took everyone by surprise.
	
### 2. Reality has branching histories, not ‘a big why’

1. **Highlight**: Political analysis often tells "Why" stories like "Immigration trumped economic interest.", but these all must be wrong or at least useless, because a referendum that passed with 51.9% majority was essentially a coin flip based on small almost-uncontrollable factors in the last few weeks.
	* **Comment**: This is mathematically correct and, in my opinion, entirely missed by most people.
		* If you would say "X happened because Y" 50% of the time, and "not(X) happened because Z" the other 50% , then clearly your ability to reason why things happened is useless. If you can explain both outcomes as being implied by the facts, you are explaining nothing.
		* IMO, most of America looks at Trump's election this way. "Trump won because X"! Well, you would have been saying "Trump lost because Y!" if he had lost. That doesn't work. Instead, talk about the thing that's true either way: how did he get within 5% of winning, instead of being at 10% of the national vote? Talk about the macroscopic trend, instead of trying to write a narrative about a coin flip.
			* and yes, the events of the last few weeks of a campaign -- "who voted", "who got pissed in the last week", "who gaffed", "how effective an ad campaign was", are essentially coin flips, though possibly slightly weighted ones.
	* "Soon our actual history seems like the only way things could have played out. Brexit had to happen. Trump had to win."
	* **Comment**: This point, more than any other, is the reason I believe Dominic's opinions about how the world works. Understanding this is a requirement to being able to "get" how the world works, and so anyone who signals knowing this is probably capable of "getting it", and anyone who doesn't signal it may not be capable of "getting it" at all, so their opinions are much more suspect.
		* this is also why I think that everyone in the world needs much much much more mathematical literacy. Because without it, you can't know what you don't know -- and with it, it's obvious how much everyone else is missing.
			* of course, that's just my impression; maybe I'm clueless and everyone actually does get this.
2. Historical examples of this happening
	* 1866 war between Prussia and Austria
	* 1888 lack of war between Prussia and Russia
	* WWI
	* Cuban Missile Crisis
	* "The branching histories are forgotten and the actual branch taken, often because of some relatively trivial event casting a huge shadow, seems overwhelmingly probable"
3. We evolved to see the world in stories...
	* but these stories obscure the branching nature of possible realities
	* we're not that irrational, just because we aren't natural Bayesians. Rationality is more than ‘Bayesian updating’
	* but data science, much more useful than stories, has recently started to enter politics.
4. Example of Andrew Marr with a classical *post facto* explanation of "Why did the referendum win?" that is obviously wrong.
5. The "Big Why?" model is the wrong way to look at history.
	* if it were right, the referendum would have passed by *much* more than 1.9%.
	* **comment**: to be precise: we can give 'Why?' stories to "how did we end up with Brexit being competitive?" -- how did it get even within 10% of winning? That's the kind of macroscopic story that isn't glossing over the coin-flips of the actual vote. What we must reject is attempts at giving a simple explanation to why the number 51.9% was not 49.9%.

### 3. Three Powerful Forces [Dominic's model of what actually happened]

1. Sometimes, campaigns don't matter and just affect the scale of victory. Examples: Reagan 1984, Blair 2001
2. Brexit was not like this. Remain was winning until near the end.
	* Claims that Leave was "really" winning the whole time are delusions
3. EU attitudes changed negatively. In one more credible, more granular poll, by 11% in the year before the vote.
4. There was *no* clear "Why?"; there was the combination of 3 big forces playing out in unpredictable ways.
	* 600,000 people (1% of registered voters) ended up making the difference.
5. Example: if Michael Gove had stayed out the campaign, Leave would have likely lost.
	* it would have collapsed or been stuck with a losing and obviously bad (by the data) message.
6. Example: Boris prevented Farage from being on TV as much in the last few weeks, which is possibly why Leave won
	* **Note**: Boris Johnson, Conservative party politician/journalist/historian; Mayor of London at the time.
	* **Note**: Nigel Farage, leader of Independence party and apparently prominent. Cummings thinks he's an idiot.
7. Example: Victoria Woodcock, manager / most significant manager of *Leave*, kept the whole thing together. Might have lost without her.
8. Summary: these three factors might have each individually decided the outcome. There's your actual "Why?" story: because things happened as they did.
9. Examples of how *Leave* was bad and barely pulled it off:
	* infighting
	* lack of resources (infighting + political risk to getting involved)
	* four posts held by distrastrous people (**Comment**: he specifically shames John Mills as Chairman, which is... a rare thing for anyone to do. Maybe it's more common in Britan, I don't know. It's shockingly blunt by my standards. I kinda like it.)
	* difficulty in getting people to say on TV what research said they needed to say
	* lack of a well-organized mass movement
10. With years to prepare, the anti-EU movement had done... almost nothing. Had to build campaign from scratch.
	* Leave.EU, another campaign (I think Farage's) was trying to sabotage *Vote Leave* (Dominic's camapaign)
11. Won witth leaflets and digital ads and volunteers -- far more than everyone else had done in years.
	* targeted crucial voters
	* data science
	* data showed the right message and, in the last 4-5 weeks, they finally got it on TV
12. most other people had spent decades on losing messages
13. won *despite* most of their own party politicians (Conservative MPs (Members of Parliament)), not because of them
	* though a few were crucial
14. **Highlight**: Most MPs, even those who had been talking about leaving EU for decades, didn't really want to win.
	* would rather talk at dinner parties, go on vacations, be on TV, etc.
	* didn't care enough to work weekends or risk annoying the prime minister who would be in charge of their post-election government placemenets
	* **Comment**: I think one of the most important models for understanding human behavior is distinguishing between "Wanting" and *Wanting*.
		* to "Want" to win is to say you want to win, to be with the side that wants to win, to say things when asked.
		* to *Want* to win is to *exert your willpower* to win. To put together a campaign, to punish mistakes, to press for victory, etc.
			* it's very tied to rationality: an incompetent buffoon gains nothing (or probably gains negatively) by exerting willpower to win.
			* and competence, true *Wanting*, looks like -- building a data science team, bringing in Actual Smart People instead of Seeming Smart People, punching through false and dated models, etc. There is a purity to it.
				* Why? because purity of thought, 'true rationality', wins, all other things being equal. It wins *by definition* -- towards whatever goal you have, being "maximally rational" should be defined as "choosing the path that most probably wins". It means finding the best models, best tactics, best people, making right choices, whatever.
		* this is why so many New Years' Resolutions fail. Because people "want" to change, but they don't *Want* to.
		* And it sounds like Brexit was won by the side and people who most *Wanted* to win. Namely, Dominic & co.
15. **Highlight**: People are happy to fail if they fail conventionally.
	* people in politics mostly would rather do a normal thing and fail than do an unconventional thing and be stigmatized when they fail.
	* "They did not mind losing so much as being embarrassed"
	* **Comment**: another point I think underlies much of how society works. Everyone's looking to do "normal-enough" seeming things that they avoid stigma. This leaves holes for people like, say, Elon Musk to come in any "play to win", as it were, and that's where actual change comes from.
		* this is what people mean when they talk about a willingness to take risks. If you try something that wouldn't be stigmatized if you failed, you haven't really taken a risk at all.
		* this means, I think, that getting over self-consciousness (fear of judgment from others, or judging yourself even without others involved) is the most important self-development. At least it is for me.
16. The *Leave* campaign was happy to fail unconventionally, and were incredibly devoted as a result.
17. Example: they ignored everyone's suggestions to hire big ad firms to do big conventional campaigns.
	* They knew that one truth of advertising is it's most effective the closer to the decision point it is.
		* **Comment**: I wonder if this is true because it affects thoughts more directly, or because it gives the other side less time to 'take back ground'?
	* so they put almost all their money (without telling anyone) into a digital campaign, and unload it right at the end of the campaign after they knew exactly what ads were most effective (from data science)
	* They hired physicists to consider everything from first principles
		* link to quote from Charlie Munger, Warren Buffet's partner, on why everyone should study physics, to learn to reason from first principles and to intuit probability.
		* **Comment**: Maybe I'm biased because I majored in physics, but I agree... so... much. I can think of no one I would rather trust with decision making than a 'true physicist', who can look at the world most clearly, do anything rationally and with numbers, and avoid (at least better than anyone else) at letting their biases and everyone else's models pollute their reasoning.
			* I also believe that physicists are the best at mathematical reasoning out of any subset of disciplines. Even math, because they do much so much more calculations and intuitive reasoning, rather than proving things. This is also why so many physics majors / PhDs / etc go into quantitative finance...
18. There were some MP heroes. Examples.

#### Rough Balance of Forces

1. List of IN's advantages
	1. IN started way ahead in polls in 2015, and was the status quo
	2. IN had the government on its side
	3. IN controlled the renegotiation [with the EU, I guess?] and its timing.
	4. IN controlled the referendum timing.
	5. IN controlled Cabinet / MPs. Risky to support *Leave*
	6. IN controlled governing party and parliament procedure.
	7. IN controlled legal rules; was able to do all sort of campaigning that didn't use their actual budget; other examples.
	8. IN had huge resources; could scare people off supporting *Leave*
	9. IN had support of most media
	10. IN had vast amounts of electoral data / other data 
	11. Lots of terrible people (Farage, etc) being linked to *Leave*
2. Coup almost won, gave control to Farage; would have tanked the campaign.
3. Farage originally wasn't going to be the face of the campaign, but later he tried -- probably to look as good as possible when the campaign (he thought) inevitably lost.
4. Unifying the Leave campaigns would have led to losing entirely.
5. MPs, not focused on winning, tried to get Farage involved.
6. If IN had campaigned effectively, they would have almost certainly won.
7. But Whitehall / the government is too ineffective and so threw it away.

#### The approximate truth

1. **Highlight** Best approximation of the truth of how Brexit passed:
	1. *Leave* won because of a combination of three big, powerful forces with global impact: 
		* the immigration crisis
		* the financial crisis
		* the euro crisis 
	2. *Leave* effectively took advantage of those forces with some effective strategies, letting them tell a psychologically effective story
	3. "Cameron and Osborne operated with a flawed model of what constitutes effective political action and had bad judgement about key people"
		* **Note**: George Osborne is a member of Cameron's cabinet
		* made critical errors. If they had not, probably would have won.
		* **Comment** I suspect that most tactical errors can be framed as "bad models", and the thing that effective people usually do, in order to be effective, is build good models over time.
2. Dominic realized before the campaign that the situation was very different than it had been when he worked on an anti-Euro campaign in ~1999-2002:
	1. The immigration crisis in the EU was much worse now, and the EU was largely blamed for it.
	2. The 2008 financial crisis had undermined confidence in the government, especially because the rich in charge of it had largely gotten away with it. Favor had swung against free markets as a result.
		* people should have been put in jail after 2008, like they were in the 1930s
	3. The euro crisis in Greece in the last few years, undermining confidence in the EU handling anything well
3. So the EU became less seen as a progressive force (and more as a proxy for immigration attitudes / etc)
4. And by 2015, no one had confidence in those in charge
	* This was obvious even in 2005 when Dominic + others won a 'practice' campaign for a smaller issue by condemning those in charge and that was before 2008
5. By 2016, people felt free to vote against the establishment if the other side was not too objectionable.
6. **Highlight**: These forces did more than every anti-EU campaign in the previous 15 years.
	* **Comment**: it makes sense that effective political action would be *not* "trying to sway public opinion on your own", it's "piggybacking on sways in public opinion to get what you want done".
7. **Highlight**: In a previous example, the Gove election reforms of 2010-2014, Dominic discovered all the media debate had done approximately *nothing* to sway public opinion.
8. re: immigration, the media discussion was not remotely indicative of actual public opinion, and this was obvious from focus groups.
9. The reaction from those in charge of the EU and Britan showed that they completely did not understand what the actual issues were.
10. So by summer 2015, only a third of the UK *wanted* to be in the EU, and the third that wanted to leave was much more enthusiastic and likely to vote. Aka "it was possible to win".

#### Vote Leave exploited these forces

1. Five simple ideas in their story that came from listening to actual people:
	1. ‘Let’s take back control’. The overall theme.
	2. ‘The official bill of EU membership is £350 million per week – let’s spend our money on our priorities like the NHS instead.’ 
		* "Sometimes we said ‘we send the EU £350m’ to provoke people into argument. This worked much better than I thought it would."
			* **Comment**: it should be obvious that this works. It's the same in American politics. It's one of the Dark Arts, but that's playing to win.
		* Despite pundits/MPs, the NHS argument was key and resonated, usually as much as immigration. Talking about what people thought they should have been talking about would have done nothing.
		* Contra cynics, they actually did mean to give money to the NHS immediately. Something apparently happened after the victory that prevented it. Something related to Tories immediately distanced themselves from it.
	3. ‘Vote Leave to take back control of immigration policy. If we stay there will be more new countries like Turkey joining... If we leave we can have democratic control and a system like Australia’s'
		* IN did not expect this and completely floundered
	4. 'The euro is a nightmare, the EU is failing, unemployment is a disaster, their debts and pensions are a disaster, if we stay YOU will be paying the bills. It’s safer to take back control...'
	5. "Anti-Establishment. E.g. We aligned our campaign with those who were furious with executive pay / corporate looting (about 99% of the country)"
		* **Comment**: This is also how you win an election in America in 2016, but the DNC did not really care to win.
2. These ideas were not bold; they were obvious. The trick was instead getting their supporters to actually say them.

#### Cameron/Osborne mistakes

1. Cameron never had to offer the referendum in the first place.
	* impulsive response to media, partly because of Cameron's terrible advisors
	* failure to understand how swing voters really think / the dangers of a vote
	* If Cameron/Osborne had had a top notch person running their campaign and they did as they were told then they would have won
		* **Comment**: Dominic attaches (>95%) confidence to some claims, like this one. On one hand that number is obviously made up. On the other it's way more convincing to anyone looking for a scientist's truth than any assurance like "I'm completely sure". It works well.
	* Some renogotiation that they did (with the EU, I guess) in Feburary 2016 was terrible and made it worse
	* "They made themselves too prominent in the campaign and were too crude. Lacking a feel for psychology they gradually undermined their own message."
	* There was some message about 'tens of thousands' that they should have dropped because it didn't work, but instead doubled down on.
	* "They suckered themselves into over-prioritising their coalition versus message."
		* example: saying that *Leave* had no good people on its side. Basically a weird sort of ignorant *ad hominem* instead of engaging with issues people cared about.
	* Steered by pundit, not actual people.
		* focus groups showed that opinions, especially outside London, were extremely different, and Cameron & Co missing them entirely.
2. Some critics said they should have been a positive campaign about the EU, and they're wrong.
	* Cameron & Osborne were right about this. Not enough time/money to change sentiment
3. **Highlight**: "I suspect that in general big mistakes cause defeat much more often than excellent moves cause victory"
	* The best moves in chess tend to leave open the biggest options later
	* Example: Bismarck
	* Leave adopted the message that, they thought, had the greatest chance of winning in the largest number of branching futures
	* **Highlight**: Humans can make major tactical errors with imperfect knowledge, compared to computers, which eliminates the benefit in going first because they get the first chance to screw up.

#### Summary of the false dichotomy

1. False: Leave won because of the campaign. Reality: they rode a big wave of factors. Campaigns can't make them.
2. False: Leave won because of a big event, not the campaign. Reality: they had to capitalize on the big events.
3. True: Leave won because of the 3 combined factors above.
4. The status quo still usually wins, and it only failed this time because of an improbable combination of events.

### 4. A ‘miracle’ to get 48%? Beaten by lies? Corbyn the AWOL saviour? [Refutations of others' models on what happened]

1. Remain *almost* won, yet now they're saying they never could have won. This is delusional.
2. ... But it's psychologically preferable. (cf Hillary's campaign also)
3. Unplausible: Corbyn sabotaged the campaign. Also, though: Corbyn's message was "unlimited immigration", which works in *no* branching futures.
	* **Note**: Jeremy Corbyn is an MP and head of the Labour party.
4. People are now talking about how big populism is, and are just as delusional as they were when they were saying how big of a force the status quo is.
5. Remain people argued they had the status quo, but also that the EU was 'complex' and overwhelmed by 'simple lies'.
6. Cameron and Osborne blaming loss on 'unreason'.
	* **Highlight**: "When you lose and you blame it on millions of people being overtaken by ‘unreason’ – after previously winning by exploiting nationalist hostility – it’s a sure sign that you are the one not reasoning straight and able to face your errors."
	* "For the likes of Osborne it is ‘irrational’ to reject the views of people like him. For most of us, people like Osborne are not experts to be trusted "
		* **Comment**: Generally it seems the big lesson in politics is figuring out what competence looks like. This is where it's important that the credible people are signalling in ways the uncredible people *can't* -- like, showing rationality. And, of course, that they're *not* signalling in the way the uncredible people *do*, such as blaming losses on irrationality.
7. People who blame defeat on 'lies' were lying constantly, but did not care (nor did media), because they're only interested in lies that go against them.
8. A rant on how much Cameron/Osborne/etc lie. 

#### Fools and knaves

1. People in IN are wrongly condemned (would have been praised if they had won); people in OUT are praised who would have been condemned if they lost.
2. Example: conditionally praising Cameron if IN won would be delusional.
	* was praised after his winning PM in 2015; now condemned for losing; both delusional.
	* "he was the best of a bad bunch picked pseudo-randomly in a broken system and out of his depth"
3. Example: people saying Dominic was clever for things that weren't even strategic choices.
	* "The timing was not ‘a brilliant move’ by me, it was a combination of good luck and seizing a tactical chance to persuade people of something I’d failed to do for weeks, but such things get rewritten as such if you win."
		* **Comment**: this is the best kind of line to include if you want to be scientifically convincing. It's anti-gloating and reads only as truth-seeking.
4. Nor is it about Nice vs Nasty people. Both on both sides.
5. In no way were they destined to win; it was a series of chance events.

### 5. Oblonsky and the frogs before the thunderstorm: fashion, delusions of the educated, and the Single Market [Model of how politics / elites' groupthink works]

1. Quote about people characterizing the referendum as being about Good vs Evil, Racist vs Not.
2. Why does political discussion have to be so depressing and fruitless?
	* "I think much has to do with the delusions of better educated people. It is easier to spread memes in SW1, N1, and among Guardian readers than in Easington Colliery." [a blue-collar coal mining town]
3. "Generally the better educated are more prone to *ir*rational political opinions and political hysteria"
	* more driven by fashion/gang mentality, which exacerbates groupthink and cognitive biases
	* less wealthy people are less likely to send signals; they think in more concrete terms
	* more wealthy consider things more abstractly, in moral and emotional terms. Don't need to be pragmatic -- insulated from, say, worrying about money.
	* **comments and more comments**: This is pretty contentious. I happen to agree with it, so I'll defend it. My mental model agrees that the better educated, while capable of, perhaps, more abstract thought and better research, tend to think more based on emotional currents, memetic ideas, and things required for social signalling with other elite.
		* For examples of this, I would point to: anytime the "middle class and up" has been shocked by something happening because they don't understand it. Who saw Trump coming? Or Brexit? Well, if you spent *any time* in poor Ameica, you would not be the slightest bit surprised that Trump won, even months before that election. So what did everyone else miss, if they're better educated?
			1. people don't *really* do research. They go looking to confirm what they already think, and they find it, because there's no shortage of explanations for it.
			2. And many politic stances are more questions of ethics or propriety anyway. The big shock with Trump was "that people would be willing to support such a jackass at all, *regardless* of his message." But in fact, that was fine with millions of people, because being appealed to and feeling 'represented' was far more important than decency for them. (Okay, that's my narrative; take it as you will.)
		* By the way, the point of this section is that the better educated are more likely to have 'irrational politic opinions'. What's an example of an irrational political opinion? The rationality of "membership in the EU is good for the UK" is pretty arbitrary and depends on a personal value system anyway. But "the UK would never vote for something like this" is a fact-checkable opinion that's now provably false. And yet it was common. 
		* I personally think that many of the ethical questions that American middle-class-and-up take as pretty cut-and-dry are not as unambiguous as they think, and that their opinions come more from tribalism than an actual reasoned or researched opinion. (I still *agree* with them on most of these things; I just think their opinions aren't coming from where they *think* they are.) 
		* Cummings talks later about this: how the platforms of major political parties can be *completely insane*, and because they are normalized they seem reasonable until closely inspected. 
			* How do you tell if a platform is insane? Well, perhaps it changes based on what seems advantageous:
				* example: marijuana legalization was, like, a ~Antifederalist position when the national government was largely against it and a Federalist position when the national government mostly supported it.
			* Or perhaps it's *obviously not working for its own stated goals*
				* cf. immigration and crime problems that the EU is failing to solve in a way that satisfies, say, most of the UK, (Cummings mentions that focus groups wanted to talk only about immigration, and the media/London didn't have any idea of that)
				* 'trickle-down' economics
				* the Drug War
				* banks being too big to fail, and neither party making it their platform to *do something about that*
			* These are the kinds of things that a *sane* platform would address directly, and an *insane* platform would skirt around, dodge, vaguely pay lip service to, etc: because they're not actually representing the interests of the people, and deserve to lose, badly, as soon someone who shows up and *does* represent everyone joins the race*
4. And also, the people explaining politics (pundits etc) don't really understand it
	* don't get dysfunctional bureaucracies work
	* or how decision making ... isn't really being done by experts at all
	* or how running a complex system is about adapting to errors, not fixing them
	* biased towards "existing, bad centralized systems" instead of functional decentralized ones
	* don't understand what actual problems people face
	* **Comment**: I tend to believe all of this about how complex systems (don't) work and want to read a more fleshed out version of it.
5. People who are more involved in media/politics -> more groupthink / tribalism.
	* act like football fans defending their team and attacking the others.
6. **Highlight**: This makes them particularly vulnerable to not having any idea what people who mostly ignore politics are thinking
	* it's impossible to get a good feel of public opinion from the people who spend all their time talking about it
	* and no one ever learns this
	* **Comment**: this is all another example of "here's a model that helps make sense of what happened". Way more powerful than just telling you who was wrong and how is explaining *why* via a framework that makes it obvious.
7.  A quote from Anna Karenina that sums this up. Short version: 
	* "Oblonsky never chose his tendencies and opinions any more than he chose the style of his hat or coat. He always wore those which happened to be in fashion"
	* "Liberalism had become a habit with Oblonsky and he enjoyed his newspaper, as he did his after-dinner cigar, for the slight haze it produced in his brain."
8. "There are many examples of how real Oblonskys, who control practically all important cultural institutions, think. They were more in favour of Britain joining the euro, not because they understood ‘the complexities’ better but because they were suckered into thinking about it as a moral test – are you on the side of the ‘baddies’ or the goodies’?"
	* **Comment** blog post idea: "Don't be an Oblonsky!" It's a great slur.
	* representative quote: "the thing is, Dominic, we like foreigners and cappuccinos and we hate racists"
9. **Highlight**: It's useful that we mindlessly agree on some things, like not killing one's enemies.
	* But makes the whole system susceptible to shocks and upsets.
	* This model can't understand Stalin or Hitler
	* Can't imagine Trump winning; can't understand Putin's behavior
10. Lots of well-educated IN voters framed it around Farage/Leave being bad and racist and vote IN to be modern and tolerant
11. ...and so don't understand the less-educated populace at all.
12. "Millions thought – there’s two gangs and I know which one I’m in."
	* Many others voted for short-term money alone. 
	* They did not "vote on the basis of deep consideration of the issues."
13. modern-day Oblonsky does the same thing on Brexit: understands nothing but feels Good.
14. and re: EU, neither most people *nor even most supposed experts* have any idea about anything.
15. Critics wanted the details of the proposed UK-EU relationship after winning. What would be the point of setting out the details of the UK-EU relationship before winning? no one knows anything about how it works.
16. "I am not aware of a single MP or political journalist who understands the Single Market"
17. "The number of people who do is tiny. In our campaign there were two who understood a large fraction of it"
	* and they were constantly explaining it to everyone else
	* **Comment**: I happen to think that the kind of person who really gets something, at a high, explain-to-anyone level -- who puts these narratives together on their own -- is the most valuable asset an organization can have. Without a real model of their world any system will flounder.
18. Cameron/Osborne "are not a duo who have ever engaged the public on a serious matter in a serious way"; ran their campaign based on hysterial warnings and conventional political wisdom
19. They tried to get the news to focus on how the EU actually works, but largely failed. No one cares and it doesn't get ratings.
20. So instead, twist it to their advantage:

#### Hack the medium, hack the message: ‘the alternative government’ launches Sunday 29 May [How they successfully used the dysfunctional media]

1. media cared about names, not issues. They couldn't do that, but they could come up with soundbite phrases like "alternative government".
2. media lapped that up.
3. and people ended up hearing, and choosing between, two simple stories, since the real issue was too complex to understand. And *Leave*'s was more psychologically compelling.
4. **Highlight**: (Hillary email leaks was the same idea: media wanted her to win but obsessed with it anyway because it was more interesting.)
	* **Comment** This seems obvious. What blows my mind is how the DNC didn't/doesn't get it. The Democrat platform in 2016 seemed to mainly be "the other side are bad people", which, while true, is *boring* and not newsworthy. If you're standing on a podium and you say the other people are bad people, what does the media run? "you gave a speech", I guess?
		* I mean, this is probably a problem with the media as much as with the campaign. But short term matters a lot. Long term I wonder how it could be fixed. Honestly I think it requires media taking a moral stance: "Day 191: trump is still a rapist" is a much better headline than "Hillary slams Trump at Arizona convention" or something. 
		* But they're averse to that. Why be averse to that if the alternative is the also-immoral "blowing a pointless scandal up to hand the other side the win"?
		* This is indicative of the absurdist bent in American politics. When someone is Really Bad, what's the mechanism for doing something about it? There isn't one, because the non-bad people with podiums can't be blunt. And the blunt people don't have the audience.

### 6. The political media and how to improve it

1. Pundits wield a lot of power, even over people like Cameron, but they're not true experts. Expertise in politics isn't possible because true expertise requires:
	1. "there is enough informational structure in the environment such that reliable predictions are possible despite complexity"
	2. "there is effective feedback so learning is possible"
2. Studies show political experts are barely better than random.
	* and the most confident seeming people are often the least right
3. and this is doubly bad because of lack of cognitive diversity; everyone mostly thinks the same thing
4. and pundits aren't accountable at all; they can confidently write one thing for months and then switch to the opposite when it seems more correct, and no one questions it
5. the media discussions on TV aren't enlightening because "there is no clear way to decide who is right about anything"
	* everything obsesses with process and scandal, which no one actually really cares about
6. They don't understand *how people learn* so they recycle incomprehensible / stupid / boring crap
	* **Comment**: Well it's probably a mistake to think their goal is for people to learn. Or to think that people are bored by it. I mean, they're *emptied* by it, but they probably enjoy the process in a sense.
7. The masses are probably *rational* in ignoring political debate. If you want to be informed you should read things and understand public opinion and *seriously challenge your own views*.
	* Time spent on mass media politics is actively hurting you. And you won't miss much if you stop.
	* "Extreme focus on important things you can control will repay far far more than time spent reading speculation about things you can’t control."
8. Dominic ignored most punditry during the campaign.
9. Ironic because of how much media is panicking about the Internet / ad revenues / etc.

#### A better way…

1. Shows should require precise quantitative predictions about well-formed questions. (so they *can* be wrong)
2. Use media to actually figure out what people learn and then earnestly try to educate them in effective ways.
	* **Comment**: well, that only works if the goal of media is education instead of mindless entertainment. But maybe, at least in the UK that has the BBC, it should be?
3. Pay for this by firing all the political correspondents and hiring smart people.
4. ...this would make everything better. It's the same approach that might actually fix political decision making, too.
5. For example, breaking down "will Brexit be a success" and putting it on a prediction platform could get dramatically better information for low cost.
6. In failing systems, young people understand things best and overpaid senior people can't figure out how to change anything.

**Comment**: This section seems very naive to me. The problem is the populace who doesn't have any appetite for this, more than the media who don't deliver it. But... they could definitely do a better job anyway. If their stated goal is effective reporting, they may as well do a better job of it, even if it's in a sensational style.

### An example of a simple, powerful media story that is wrong and contributed to forecasting errors on Brexit – ‘the centre ground’

1. "One of the most misleading stories in politics is the story of ‘the centre ground’".
	* Model categorizing voters as extremists vs moderates 
2. "The story is deeply flawed and where it is not trivially true it is deeply misleading."
3. Swing voters, who decide elections, do not think like this.
	* They're for things on both sides: tough policies on crime AND higher taxes on rich, etc
4. Example: delusion re immigration, that there must be a center ground, when actually 80% of the country was far on one side against immigration
5. Anecdote: he talked to a focus group of Labour voters for 20 minutes without realizing they weren't Tories because they sounded the same when discussing immigration
6. **Highlight**: Media categorized *Leave* as Right Wing / fringe?, but they were actually addressing to what the majority of the country was thinking.
7. Similar story with Trump: labeled as 'populist right' but actually it was talking to the mainstream.
8. **Highlight**: Doesn't occur to SW1/London that *their* outlook is the fringe one.
	* eg "Have an immigration policy that guarantees free movement rights even for murderers, so we cannot deport them or keep them locked up after they are released? Extreme"
	* 8 other examples.
	* **Comment**: This idea is supremely important for understanding American politics. Or rather, understanding what's so loathesome about American politics. I don't know of any serious attempt to reconnect the political reality with actual reality, even after Trump. Everything keeps on  feeling absurd.
9. Cameron, Blair, etc seem like extremists to the pragmatic public.
	* **Comment**: of course the public wouldn't use that word. They need this model in order to think that way. That's why I like it.

### 7. Why I got involved and my role

1. Dominic did not want things this way -- thought the referendum was a long shot, and pushing for it without a serious attempt to win was foolish.
	* People lobbied for it because it was simpler than figuring out the actual problem: how the UK-EU relationship should work.
2. wiser to wait for Cameron to go and then get someone in charge who actually wanted to solve UK-EU relationship
	* would have worked a lot better to make a series attempt at repair, and give EU time to prepare, than the charade of "renegotiation" + referendum
	* and then, if fixing things didn't work, *Leave* would have won by a lot and it would have induced actual introspection / fixing things.
3. Cameron shouldn't have even promised a referendum. Most people did not even want it.
4. Everyone panicked when the referendum was going to actually happen; no one had been working together and were not prepared to fight for it.
5. Dominic had to choose between ignoring it and feeling miserable about the 'tragicomic' campaign, or throwing in with it and making his life worse.
	* decided to go for it because changes to upheave things come along rarely
	* slim chance of high impact is worth the gamble
	* might not have joined from retirement (wife was pregnant a month later)

#### Why do it?

1. Thought Leave would improve probability of:
	1. Britain contributing positively to world
	2. Minimizing dangers
	3. minimize Britan's exposure to problems
	4. encouraging fixing things, like free movement, before they get out of control
	5. maybe trigger rewiring of UK government, hopefully improving things like education
	6. maybe build new institutions for international cooperation that avoid disasters
2. main issue with EU, by physicist David Deutsch:
	* "Preserving the institutions of error correction is more important than any policy… Whether errors can be corrected without violence is not a “concern” but a condition for successfully addressing concerns.’"
3. Healthy and effective systems like our immune system and the English common law allow constant and rapid error-correction. 
	* but not: UK government, EU government
	* centralized; hierarchical. Problems are not solved.
4. The delusion of "influence" -- influence actually comes from demonstrating success. [Is this influence on other nations? Not sure]
5. Dominic thought that:
	* 1930s protectionism's return would be a disaster
	* no action on immigration / terrorism + criminal rights would lead to this
	* best policy is to reduce unskilled immigration; increase skilled immigration, especially CS/physics/STEM
	* hopefully will motivate rest of Europe to limit immigration to save free trade
6. Did not succeed in getting SW1 to think about any of this. Instead people thought of EU = free trade, controlled immigration, non-protectionism / working together

#### What was my role?

1. Role:
	1. Suppress infighting / coalition warfare so about 10 people could solve the actual problems
	2. building the team
	3. management
	4. a few important decisions about message / policy
	5. providing clear focus, and saying 'no' to almost everything else
	6. dealing with big problems
2. Main job was not, as the media thought, talking to them. It was management.
	* averse to confrontation
	* not motivated by people liking him
	* Lots of politics is mismanaged because people act for social reasons instead of for results, and incentives don't prevent this.
3. I do not hate Cameron, but doesn't respect him. 
	* Cameron wants to "Be" rather than to "Do".
	* And is mostly but not entirely bad at his job.
4. I follow projects that I thinks are worthwhile, not parties.
5. Farage said I did the campaign to destroy it from the inside, which is stupid.
6. I'm not particularly clever. Just: "I have had success in building and managing teams. This success has not relied on a single original insight of any kind."
7. "Effective because they work reliably, simple enough that even I could implement them, and ‘unrecognised’ because they are hiding in plain sight but are rarely stolen and used."
	* Got 10-15 people to work, hard, and then just made sure they could work.

----

1. Will post more blogs on the referendum
2. And released their voter information collection platform as open-source [well, that seems noble?]

## Summary of the summary

Well, that was amazingly long, and that was just an outline. Dang.

Here are the key ideas, distilled. I think a book could be written about each of these.

### 1. There are not simple 'Why?' stories, especially not in close elections. "How it happened" is subtle. 

Things happen due to a combination of random events. Thinking in *post facto* 'Why?' stories is wrong and anyone telling them doesn't get it. Pundits/experts are largely clueless, and aren't experts at all, and that will remain true until there's a way to tell who the experts are.

The complicated, not Just-So story of how Brexit passed is approximately:

1. Longstanding tension from Immigration, Euro, and Financial crises.
2. The *Leave* campaign effectively capitalizing on these, with an effective message.
3. ... the *Remain* campaign failing to find a good message and being run incompetently.
4. Good management in the *Leave* campaign having a good understanding of how to win, an actual scientific approach, and preventing their own side from imploding their efforts -- all got them in the ballpark of winning.
5. Luck did the rest

### 2. People in media/politics are unrational, delusional, ineffective

Thought-bubbles / groupthink are pervasive, especially among the well-educated and wealthy who are more prone to fashionable opinions, signalling, and generally being Oblonskys. They tend to not have to consider pragmatic viewpoints and to frame things in detached moral terms. 

Eg they might think "immigration should be open and if you disagree you're racist" and reject out-of-hand "there's something seriously wrong with immigration right now and we need to action" (when the latter should be almost indisputable, *even* if you agree with the former). The less-educated / lower class would just adopt the second viewpoint directly, having no need for the moral stance.

Also:
* Politics/media people would rather fail conventionally than take real risks to win -- especially *social* risks.
* *Wanting* to win means *actually trying* -- working weekends, for starters, but also using actual data, hiring actually smart people, not caving to social pressures, scientifically evaluating your own tactics from first principles (ie not using the wrong message on purpose), and tossing out preexisting assumptions that don't stand up.
* And it requires being *rational*: having a model of the world that gets you closer to thinking clearly. Dominic Cummings is a rare example of this. Cameron + Osborne were not. Other OUT MPs/figures were not.
* Understanding Brexit, Trump, Hitler, or Stalin requires being smarter than this and seeing how the world actually works, outside of the filter bubble.
* How to actually be smart on politics: make concerted effort to get outside your bubble and understand diverse viewpoints. And especially, make an honest effort to refute your own position.

### 3. What's wrong with the world / what's required to understand Brexit and Trump

Three major crises happened in Europe between 2000 and 2015 and haven't been resolved, setting a very different stage for the referendum compared to when it was first discussed. Nothing reasonable and 'moderate' is being done about them. 

1. The EU lacks error-correction institutions to handle immigration/crime problems, and Dominic supported leaving it to, possible, trigger doing something about that before a much bigger catastrophe emerges. 
2. The financial crisis produced no *reasonable* response. The political response, "punishing no one", is an *extreme* position that no one else takes seriously, and this has destroyed faith in the establishment.
3. The media is happy to blow up pointless sensational things and is completely incapable of effectively educating people about important things, which is how *Leave* and Trump are able to use them to their advantage (cf Hillary's emails).

The whole 'center ground'/moderate model of politics is wrong, and leads to everyone misunderstanding how swing votes work. It's people who disagree with everyone -- who are waiting for someone to come along and speak to what actually matters, instead of the convoluted angles the media/parties actually take. Pragmatic platforms and actually listening can harness them.

The political world's ignorance of this is extremely dangerous.

Dominic supported Brexit even though it wasn't the best strategy because it came at a ripe time to actually do something significant to the world. He hopes it can shock the sclerotic UK / non-error-correcting EU into fixing things before it's too late.

### 4. How to win a campaign / effect change.

Have an effective psychological message. "Take back control", Anti-establishment, pragmatic answers to immigration crises, etc worked. Cameron/Osborne's did not. Big mistakes cause defeat, more than excellent moves cause victory.

Change comes from market/economic/cultural forces, not top-down decision-making. Capitalize on that. Figure out how the world actually works (in this case, the media and the general population's opinions), and strategize around that.

Consider everything from first principles. Get and use data. Don't try to 'lose fashionably'. Play to win. Implement "unrecognised simplicities of effective action".

Get lucky.

### 5. What's wrong with political media

Expertise in politics is impossible right now. Requires concrete predictions, comparing to results. No clear way to decide who's right about anything. Media *could* become effective at educating people, but has not. But still has undue influence due to what it foolishly makes important / sensationalizes.

### 6. How to be an effective manager

Get a small team of smart, motivated people and keep everyone else from distracting them. Come up with a plan and don't let the masses / egotists / etc mess with it. Keep people on course with a tried/tested/scientifically validated strategy, instead of making it up from the gut.

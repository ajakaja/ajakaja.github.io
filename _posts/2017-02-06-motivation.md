title: "Attempt at Understanding Motivation"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

In an effort to be more productive towards my goals (productive at all, really), I've been meditating on what it feels like to be motivated to do various tasks.

That's not 'meditating on' as in "the pretentious way of saying 'thinking about'"; that's literally meditating -- trying to focus my attention on the feeling of being driven to do or not do something, and what that feels like, in order to tease out an understanding of how motivation works that might be useful.

This kind of meditation feels like it is making me better at pinpointing and paying attention to specific mechanisms in how I think. Unfortunately describing what you feel in your brain in words is similar to trying to identify objects in the dark by touch alone -- revelations are sketchy at best, and come *very* slowly. I think I've made some progress, though.

(As usual I don't know how much this model applies to anyone else, but it's probably slightly more than "not at all".)

## Mechanisms of Motivation

I've observed seven disjoint types of 'reasons I do things' -- well, at least they *feel* disjoint. These is specifically mechanisms that *directly induce* actions; there are other mechanisms involved that can prevent actions. I'm calling those 'Antagonistic' for now, and they're in a later section.


1. **Habit**: mindless actions, such as preparing breakfast, getting dressed, or browsing the internet. A learned 'filler' behavior. Sometimes described as 'zombie mode', where your consciousness is rarely activated and you proceed automatically. They take zero willpower.
I find that in Habit Mode I bounce between actions that I'm accustomed to doing (watching TV, browsing websites, responding to messages, eating) without much of an opportunity to break out and do something I 'want' to be doing. When I have habits to do things I want to be doing (reading, playing piano), I tend to be doing them with little engagement, so my reading retention is low and my piano practice is ineffective (but better than nothing).
Most of your time is spent in Habit Mode, so it's up to you to find ways to cause it to be useful, or at least not-destructive. (The phrasing "cause it to be useful" is healthier than "make it useful", to emphasize that you only really have indirect control over it.)

2. **Compulsion**: driven by instinctual reactions. A strong repulsion to a dirty room will cause you do clean the room without much willpower. Hunger, tiredness, need to urinate, sexual attraction, etc are also in this category. They're distinct systems in your body that 'chime in' to your thought processes, but seem to function similarly with respect to motivation. 
Tendencies to seek pleasure or comfort, or avoid discomfort, seem to work this way: a desire for something (possibly triggered by your reward system firing preemptively, such as when your brain becomes aware a pleasurable sensation (such as delicious food) is available?) or to eliminate a discomfort (scratching an itch, turning up the heat, getting water, clean your room) appears, and if it's strong enough it compels you into a behavior towards the goal.
Your brain 'works backward' from a compulsory desire to generate actual behaviors. For example, physical attraction to a person may make you start talking to them, whereupon the language part of your brain seems to be able to figure out what to say; the 'physical attraction' circuit doesn't take on the task of actually determining how you flirt.
Those Antagonistic systems can react to situations and trigger actions: fear or embarassment or anxiety can cause one to flee a situation, become defensive, or take an action to avoid the situation in the first place.

3. **Duty**: doing things because they're your job to do, or because you've already resolved to do them. "Checklist"-type actions fall in this category: if you have, say, errands you need to run, it's easy to just execute each of them in turn without much thought. Duties are distinguished from Habits because they feel different to me: Habits are familiar actions that naturally trigger themselves when I'm not preoccupied, while Duties are preplanned actions that you've already mentally committed to doing, so they just happen even though they may be unfamiliar.
Duties seem to be very easy to execute as long as no Antagonistic systems interfere, so if you're comfortable doing a task and have already committed mentally to doing it, it tends to happen unless there's a significant distraction. When you want to do something consistently but don't have an established habit of doing it, you do it as a Duty. But if you make a to-do list of things you want to run as Duties, but have no Habit of actually doing the items off your list, you may never make it as far as starting them.
A commitment to another person (to meet them for dinner, say, or to work work out them) seems to cause the action to become executed by the Duty system. So too does just deciding you're going to do something, particularly if you are forced to choose to do *something* (such as choosing what you're going to cook).

4. **Conscious**: macroscopic tasks you want to accomplish, such as "work out" or "build a website" or "write a paper" or "have a picnic in the park this afternoon". Your consciousness gets a lot of input on these. These are easy to work on up to a point, but once derailed they're hard to recover. Whether these take willpower to do seems to depend on how much other systems of your mind don't want you to do them.
What kinds of conscious choices I make seems closely coupled to my *mental model of my identity*. Imagining myself as a Person Who Is Spontaneous causes me to do spontaneous things -- for instance, waving at a stranger from afar seems like a thing that I model myself as doing, and so I'm comfortable doing it. Doing things that feel 'out of character' for me are conversely very difficult, even with premeditation. What character I'm comfortable portraying is dependent on the social situation, so I do different kinds of things around differents kinds of people to whom I've displayed variations on my identity in the past.

5. **Flow**: ancillary tasks to other tasks which happen automatically in the 'Flow' [state of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)), especially in support of tasks from your Conscious system. When deciding to cook a meal or build a website, say, the individual tasks you have to figure out in order to complete the larger puzzle take little willpower. You automatically study the problem, identify and solve subproblems, and execute subtasks until the high-level task is complete.
Flow tasks differs from Habit tasks in that you're usually exploring new territory and being creative, easily incorporating analytical calculations and lateral, creative thinking. But, the flow state is easily interrupted, especially by social interactions, and is hard to return to once lost. Eliminating distractions and frustrations is highly profitable.
The Flow version of reading, as opposed to the Habit version, involves lots of active thinking in response to the text, and seems to lead to much more comprehension and retention. The Flow version of writing or speaking is marked by knowing where you are in the big idea and how the point you're making connects to it (as compared to the 'Duty' version, which I'm using right now to fill out my outline of this post without keeping in mind the full structure or why I was so eager to write it down.)

6. **Reaction**: immediate, 'System 1' reactions to things. Your brain replies to situations without any high-level goal-oriented processing, as though your action short-circuited your decision-making machinery. 
A lot of conversation seems to run this way: your brain responds immediately using practiced, comfortable replies, faster than you consciously process what's happening. It feels like your body is being controlled by a fast-running real-time circuit that doesn't preplan actions (and maybe hooks more directly into language faculties so it can respond to things more quickly). This also includes physical reactions, like flinching when something flies at your face or screaming when scared.
Reactive social actions aren't just speech, either; they may include "defending someone" or "returning a smile" or "shaking hands". They feel like the result after your brain pattern-matches 'the situation it recognizes itself as being in' to familiar situations and derives "actions it's comfortable taking there."
Sometimes conversation-mode Reactive actions seem to overlap with Flow actions, particularly when arguing, but I'm not sure entirely how it works.

7. **Empathy**: such as assisting or comforting someone else, which doesn't seem to necessarily fall in another category. Helping someone *can* be motivated by other systems (say, to appear altruistic for social benefit, or out of embarrassment or guilt) but at least sometimes it feels to me like it's motivated purely by goodwill.
Empathy feels kind of like your Compulsion system chiming in to fix problems and increase pleasures, but it's running for someone else instead of yourself. That is, it feels like you're still considering *your*  desires and discomforts, but the *you* concept is referring to multiple literal human beings (you plus whoever you're empathizing with), which causes the Compulsion system to come up with things like "I need to help this person with the task they're struggling with" or "I need to help this person I care about because they are visibly distraught".
(Empathy is pretty specific compared to the others on this list, but I have to include it because it feels disjoint from them. There are probably other awfully-specific types missing also that I haven't thought of yet.)

### Examples

Here are some examples of how these work in daily life:

* You need to do some math homework. The time you've allotted comes around, so you sit down and open the book and start reading (Duty) but you're not reading very carefully and you go through the whole thing without much understanding (Habit), though you have started to build the mental lattice to fill in later. You go to do the first homework problem and are stumped, but after a while you get into Flow and start scouring the chapter for hints on how to proceed, and eventually get it. A friend texts you and you get distracted, and go back into Habit mode, eventually getting distracted and ending up browsing Facebook. After a while you realize that it's getting late and you might not be done in time, and that causes a sudden panic (Compulsion), which makes you silence your phone and get back into the problems. You get back into Flow and finish the work without much trouble.

* After making a resolution to go the gym in the morning three times a week, you Consciously force yourself to do it once. You tell your friends you went and plan to keep going, causing it to feel like a promise that's tied to your maintaining their respect, so you go because Compulsion wants you to avoid embarrassment. Your friends stop paying attention after a few weeks, though, and you start skipping days and eventually stop entirely.
One day a friend says they want to go with you, and you agree to meet, which is easy to follow through on because Duty lets you do things you've precommitted to. You realize that you need a new system if you want fitness to stick, so you start a daily routine of going to the gym or running every morning at exactly the same time. This lasts for a while because your Duty system gets involved every time, until after a month it's totally ingrained and you no longer have to think about wanting to do it -- working out first thing is now run by Habit, and comes as naturally as eating breakfast.

* You agree after work to go hang out at a bar with your coworkers. Agreeing is an easy Reactive action, and Duty follows through with meeting them there because you said you would. Once there, you hang out and talk, using Reactive actions, until you're asked to explain something complicated and you go into Flow for a while, explaining the subject in detail and fielding questions, building a mental model for yourself (and your audience) as you go, and filling in the gaps as people ask you questions.
Later, when your closer friends have left and there's a lull in the conversation, you feel a bit awkward and Compulsion makes you excuse yourself to go to the bathroom to get out of the situation. When you get back you go and order a drink at the bar, a comfortable task under Habit. You see a stranger you think is cute and get a self-conscious about your appearance. You stand up straighter and glance in their direction instinctively (Compulsion). They smile and you smile back (Reaction), but look away because you're a bit embarrassed (Compulsion).
You go back to your table and hang out some more, idly conversing with Reaction. Someone near you spills a drink on the ground, making a loud clatter, and you go to help them. 
    * If it's a close friend, you might help them out of Empathy, to help them with their problem and to alleviate embarrassment.
    * If it's an acquaintance, you might help out of Duty, if your mental model is that it's 'your job' to help immediately.
    * If no one goes to help, you might help them out of Compulsion, to avoid an awkward situation.
    * If it's the person you thought was attractive, then 
        * if you're pretty confident in these situations, you might find yourself with a Compulsion to go help them, and jump up and do it. 
        * If you're unconfident, you might have to Consciously force yourself to help, even though it's awkward for you, because Antagonistic forces are suppressing your Compulsion.

## Antagonistic Forces

Other systems in your body like to chime in and disrupt tasks that you're working on. Whether or not they disrupt you entirely depends on how strong the antagonistic effect is and how disciplined you are at working through it.

When these systems *cause* you to do things, I filed them under 'Compulsory' actions, above. But they also interfere with *other* types of motivation in an inhibitory way. They're the same instinctual mechanisms, just manifesting differently.

The general pattern is that negative emotions or confusion can cause tasks to come 'slippery', inaccessible to your Conscious and Reactive systems without a lot of willpower. You *can* execute them via Duty (if doing them involves forging forward despite anxieties) or Flow (if doing them involves overcoming uncertainty), but it's tricky to get them started.

Here are some Antagonistic mechanisms that I've recognized:

1. **Uncertainty**: at how to complete a task. The Flow state is good at escaping this, but if you don't get into it, you can find yourself paralyzed by bewilderment -- for instance, if you're need to pay taxes for the first time in your life, until you manage to go 'into the zone' to figure it out, you may avoid the task even when you plan to do it.

2. **Frustration**: at a solution that isn't working; for instance, when a problem becomes so hard to complete, or when a solution doesn't seem to be working or seems out of your grasp. You become flooded with negative emotions and your mind tries to escape the situation.

3. **Self-Consciousness**: at other's judgments of you or your ability while you're performing a task. Your mind is capable of constructing the negative emotions you'll feel if someone judges you later, even before you're in that situation, and these negative emotions cause your mind to take 

4. **Apprehension**: of possible negative outcomes, whether rational or not. This probably includes feeling physically unsafe, such as when walking alone at night, but might also apply to any situation that causes anxiety, such as if you know you become nervous when driving a car or dancing in public, or even just in large crowds or around strangers.

5. **Hesitation**: at committing to an outcome. For example, making a choice about your future, such as where you will travel, what school you will attend, or accept a job. Or something more minor, such as whether you will find a way to go to an event.

6. **Unpleasantness**: sometimes your brain seems to just not want to do something because doing it is directly unpleasant, such as doing inordinately difficult tasks, doing hard work while exhausted, reading something you're not enjoying, or hanging out with someone whose company you don't enjoy. You may find yourself unconsciously avoiding the activity even though, if asked directly, you'd be able to immediately realize that you don't enjoy it and *want* to avoid it. Sometimes you're *supposed* to enjoy it, so there's a social barrier in admitting that you don't, causing you to only avoid it subconsciously.

7. **Identity Clash**: you'll have trouble doing things that don't seem like 'things people like you do'. The same way conscious choices are usually only things that you can imagine yourself doing, you'll feel a strong negative feeling if you try to make a Duty to do something that's unlike you -- for instance, you can write on your to-do list that you're going to go to a yoga class, but if you see that as uncomfortable for purely social reasons, you'll find that it keeps not happening. You can, however, find another way to look at the action -- if you can manage to mentally reframe it as "you're a person who likes to try new things", a much more positive identity, you can probably get yourself to go.

7. **Lower-level drives**: strong hunger, thirst, exhaustion, discomfort, etc can of course clobber your desire to do other things. ("Distraction" doesn't really count here: it switches the mode your mind is in, true, but it doesn't have the characteristic 'slippery' effect on initiating a task.)

Meanwhile, your brain is good at [rationalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation) why it avoided doing something: it will happily concoct excuses that seem to make sense, the real reason is anxiety coming from some other subsystem. It feels like 'subconscious' subsystems in the mind influence your behavior by *causing* you to avoid actions without telling your rational, observant mind exactly what they did. This leaves you to piece together what happened.

It can be hard to see this as it happens. Perhaps you need to do homework, but have anxieties about the material after doing badly last week. You might find yourself procrastinating for hours in Habit mode, or Consciously deciding to do other things, and then be frustrated with yourself afterwards for never starting your work -- because Antagonistic systems interfered and made all the systems that *could* decide to do it unwilling to push hard enough to make it happen. Or perhaps you have trouble admitting the real reason you don't want to do something (such as being self-conscious about asking someone out) so you rationalize a plausible-sounding reason (such as not really being interested) instead.

### How sleep fits in

Sleep-deprivation seems to cause me to be dramatically less able to work through Antagonistic mechanisms. This means I end up finding myself working off of the Habit or Compulsion systems much more often, because those can find things to do without having to confront anxiety-inducing situations. My 'Duty' and 'Conscious' systems are suppressed because the things they would normally cause me to do are plagued with anxiety. I'm still *capable* of Flow, but I never end up actually doing it because getting there requires another trigger that never occurs.

(I'm not sure if everyone gets this. I'm a pretty anxious person, to the point where it would probably be officially characterized as an anxiety disorder. I also sleep erratically a lot of the time, making my anxieties a lot more chronic than they need to be.)

(Other negative effects of sleep deprivation: crippled memory and learning, reduced skill at social Reaction behaviors, health effects that cause more anxiety. Just your friendly reminder that sleeping regularly is the most important thing you can do for your mental health.)

### Anxiety

I'm prone to anxiety. The *mechanism* by which anxiety interferes with my life is by constantly functioning Antagonistically, preventing me from taking all sorts of actions that I'd otherwise like to be taking.

Familiar stories from my life:

* I'm trying to get myself to do something that's difficult and uncertain, like deciding vacation plans. I sit down with every intent to work on it, but accidentally find that an hour has disappeared because my brain finds beginning the task slippery, so finds mindless Habit-level actions to do instead.

* I'm trying to get myself to finish something where I've made a mistake, such as finishing a task for work that's going to be late because I misestimated how long it would take. I find myself procrastinating by answering emails and solving small side tasks because I don't want to confront my error on the main task.

* The same as above, but I get additional frustration once I realize I'm struggling to work the main task, and get into a foul mood because I don't understand why my body isn't letting me do something I need to do. I go home and fall asleep, and have to embarrassedly explain why the task isn't done the next day.

The other thing about anxiety is that it tends to bleed over into other tasks. The state of "needing to do a task, but avoiding it for Antagonistic reasons" causes me to also have my will to do *other* tasks suppressed. Colloquially, this one task in my life is 'stressing me out'. But it's not always easy to see that that's happening, so you might find yourself at work getting nothing done (and getting frustrated with yourself) because something from your life outside work is bothering you.

The example that triggered my whole introspection into motivation and anxiety: someone I have a crush on acted in a way that made me feel self-conscious and embarrassed, and I kept turning the event over in my head and feeling more frustrated about it. I came home and had a sink full of dirty dishes to do (which should be an easy Compulsory-level action to take care of) but instead watched television for hours because the anxiety from feeling self-conscious was antagonizing my drive to do anything besides the simplest Habit-level task.

(I wish I could say that cleaning dishes was something I do as a Habit, but it's not; I have to force myself to do it Compulsorily -- either by reacting to the gross state of the kitchen, or not wanting to be annoying to my housemate. Going to bed on time also isn't a Habit for me, so I tend to stay up for hours when I'm anxious about other things.)


## Conclusions for Productivity

I wrote in a [previous post](/2017/01/13/behavior.html) some guesses about how to establish habits of productivity, since I've been battling with that a lot. But this new model seems able to easily derive those observations.

The core realization is that **rarely do you get to drive your behavior with direct willpower**. When you *do* get conscious control, you should use it to make decisions that set yourself up for success the rest of the time. Instead of willing yourself to the gym, will yourself to sign up for a repeating session that Duty can commit to. Instead of willing yourself to do a difficult task, will yourself to practice how to make it easier.

Eliminating anxieties or uncertainties around a task gets rid of the 'slipperiness', and allows it to be Dutifully checked off or executed when necessary. Eliminating self-consciousnesses and anxieties around social situations lets you function normally in them, instead of having Compulsions to escape or avoid them.

Eliminating *unrelated* Antagonistic anxieties and uncertainties helps too, since they bleed over into other tasks.

Our general algorithm for productivity problem solving is: eliminate anxieties around a task, especially by using a different motivational method to do it once or occasionally, enough to become comfortable with it and learn the basics. Then, for one-time tasks we want to execute them as Duties, and successfully engage Flow if necessary. For establishing Habits we go far out of our way to make them totally automatic, willpower-less actions -- ideally so far that you're more comfortable doing them than *not* doing them.

Making permanent changes to your lifestyle basically requires establishing Habits or retooling your Compulsions -- keeping a clean kitchen requires either a daily routine of cleaning the kitchen, or a visceral response of disgust to having a dirty one that compels you to do it; either one works.

Getting *to* that state with a lifestyle change is an exercise of exploiting Duty, Conscious, and Compulsion tasks until you can get the machinery in place to make it permanent.

---------

I've heard it said (but haven't tested) that tasks that feel slippery can be performed by trying to execute them in a different frame of mind. For example, if you need to get yourself to execute the Duty task of doing dishes, but something seems to be making you avoid it, try doing it in the Flow state: attempt to do the absolute most slow, deliberate, beautifully elegant job of dish-cleaning you can, without maximum efficiency of water use and without wasting a muscle movement. Turn it into a game of sorts.

If a task, especially a social one, is frustratingly slippery, try doing a slightly different task that isn't. If you want to dance in public but can't get yourself to seriously try due to anxiety, try doing it 'as a joke' -- it can feel completely different. It might be enough, after a try or three, to make the regular action more comfortable for you.

Social anxieties around social tasks can be alleviated by getting reassurance from friends about things -- for instance, that "s/he actually likes you, promise" will make it easier to ask them out, and a quick "you're doing fine" can be the difference between being mortified and quitting something early, and sticking it out. (Offering these helping hands of anxiety reduction to others is a lovely thing to do, also, and if you want someone to join you at something in the future alleviating their anxieties is a great step to take.)

Conscious, Duty, and Reactive behaviors have to be in line with your identity, to avoid identity-clash Antagonizers. I won't talk about what changing your identity entails here, except to say: it can be easiest to do at boundaries in your life, where you can try to redefine yourself ("now that I've got a job, I'm going to be a person who goes to the gym all the time.").

It can also be possible to reframe actions so they *do* match your identity: you may feel anxious about, say, going to a public-speaking seminar, but if you imagine yourself as "a person who tries anything once", and you put on your "just here to try something new" persona while you're doing it, it may become pallatable.

The everyday model of how discipline and productivity work can a great deal of anxiety, of the form "how come everyone else can get their work done and I can't?". I think if nothing else, a better model of how motivation works and how it interacts with anxiety can lead you to judge yourself more fairly, which should let you reduce anxiety about your own procrastination -- which may, ironically, directly make you more productive.

If you're trapped in a cycle of anxiety that's preventing you from taking unrelated actions, you might need to sleep way more than you realize. Prioritize solving any sleep problems over everything else.

### Postscript

**Disclaimer**: This model is a vague sketch-artist attempt at comprehending mental phenomena. As far as I know it's so vague that it's not really falsifiable as a whole, which means it's branded as nonscientific. My only evidence is that it *feels like* it's true, and all I can do it try to update it if new things start to feel like they're true in the future.

With introspection and self-understanding, progress often comes in the form of hearing someone else put an abstract realization of theirs into concrete terms, causing you to realize that it's seems to apply to you, too. I'm hoping this does that for others, since it feels like a pretty good description of my reality. If it doesn't sound right, then perhaps I've totally misunderstood myself, or perhaps there's a lot more variance in how people's mental machinery is wired together than I realized.

**Moralization**: I think that a lot of how our brains works is far *more* explicable just through observation than we admit, and that it's a noble cause to try to make progress on it. A great deal of frustration and anxiety comes out of our *model* of "how humans behave" clashing with our *experience* of "how we find ourselves behaving". Improving that model can immediately benefit us in reducing stress and frustration with ourselves, and that's not even counting if it can make us more productive towards our goals.

Motivation is one of many aspects of, er, the human experience about which I think we can much more concrete. I'm not saying what I've written here is the correct answer, but I think it's a good exercise on the path towards a correct answer, and it's already helped me understand how my brain works better than anything I had before. 

It's unscientific, sure, but maybe the point is just to put new models in the air for people to test against their experience, and somewhere far down the road maybe the ones that endure can be used to inform more rigorous scientific investigation. Or something like that.

I want to blog every day, now, as promised. I also already wanted to 'work' every day, and I've felt that way for at least a year (probably more like 8). It never sticks, because doing that *isn't me* -- in a sense. But in what sense? Can I change that?

<!--more-->

(Digression: keeping with the overwrought-yet-satisfying analogy to wizardry, when I say I want to 'work' every day, I mean I want to 'study and master ancient tomes of forbidden lore'. And by 'forbidden lore' I mean 'anything Interesting', and that's a capital I to refer to this specific kind of interesting that I find, er, addictive. The history of, say, a WWII battle is interesting but not *Interesting*, because it doesn't *allude to the secret nature of the universe*. A WWII battle *can* allude to the secret nature of the universe, if what happens hints at some universe truth of human nature, or causality, or intuition, or inevitability. Artistic or dramatic revelations count. But it doesn't necessarily do this. Neither does any part of math, per se, but many parts do, and I would like to learn them all.)

### How not to forcibly implement a habit

Confession: I didn't blog every day. I failed by day 3. At least three reasons:

* For the first 2.5 days, I did successfully a "this is what I do now" feeling to working on writing. I'm familiar with this (more later).
* I became quite sick on day 3 and that severely dampered my ability to keep working. The illness has been on and off for a week but it's wrong to say that it has totally prevented work on this.
* The actual reason for stopping: the thing I tried to write about on Day 3 wasn't as fully-formed as the first two, but I didn't want to skip it to get to more fully-formed ideas. I stared at it and typed lots of things I didn't like and gave up.

I've spent lots of time this week thinking about things that are write-able, and I'm (was already) pretty convinced that this blogging experiment is going to consist of writing posts dumping each interesting idea in as an approximately coherent form, at least until I get better at it. It's suddenly clear that it's not going to work to pick a plan for what to write about ahead of time and make myself do it the day of -- at least where I am right now, it just won't happen. A better approach will be waiting until I get excited thinking about something, and then writing that down, whatever it is. Phrased as a lesson, that's **Lesson: do what your brain feels like, not what you want it to do** (you can try to change what it feels like but that's a *separate task*.)

It's not possible to implement that as "each day, wait until a good idea comes about, then write about it". Daily work requires being ahead of the daily schedule on output, because there will always be bad (or sick) days. I'm confident I have more than one writeable (by my standards, not yours!) idea per day, on average, so the way to succeed at this is to rapidly collect half-finished ideas when I'm free and my mind seems to be working correctly, and then work through publishing those at the one-per-day rate afterwards. **Lesson: you have to be way ahead of a schedule to keep it, if the work requires luck**. Obvious in hindsight (obvious in foresight too, but the trick is framing it onto your situation, not realizing it abstractly). Concrete implication: the average good day should be publishing one post, but working on two, three, or five. That will let bad days be fine.

It has to be fine, also, to fail to abide by the system. Both to skip days by accident and to skip  because the brain didn't work that day. It's good to set yourself personal accountability systems (=committing to a blog post a day), but it's necessary to calibrate how you feel about breaking them. The emotional reaction needs to be enough to prevent you from failing if it's relatively easy not to fail, while not being so much that failure leads to a whirlwind of stress. (I also prefer the mindset that no work is better than low-quality work, or work that doesn't feel like my 'heart' is behind it in a sense.) **Pick how you feel about failure carefully. You *do* get to pick; it's your system.** Pick such that you will survive failures and still want to avoid them.

It's also fine to change the system. I suspect I'll eventually uncommit to every day and keep it at something like every week day. I haven't decided yet whether the "Day N" titles will skip numbers if I miss days or not. In this case since I just started I'll be editing the first couple posts to have occurred yesterday and the day before.

In order to keep doing something like this, which involves this mental process of 'projecting yourself outward and swallowing your self-consciousness', it's important to be continuously somewhat happy with what you've created. Guilt or shame destroys the willpower to continue, in my experience. As such it seems important to let yourself correct self-consciousnesses, if doing so is easy, such as by editing previous posts. **Let yourself do things that make abiding your system easier.** (I noticed this was important when I saw it on BetterExplained's [retrospective](https://betterexplained.com/articles/life-lessons-10-years/)).

Incidentally, I've observed that the 'this is awkward' circuits, which normally fire when reading other people's writing, are disabled when reading my own for a few days after the writing, but reengage after that. So re-reading several days later gives a very different perspective. This adds points to the "be okay with editing your own stuff after publishing" column, but it adds a lot more points to "write everything a few days early so you have time to reread it" one.

### Habits as Identities

How do you start doing something every day you didn't do at all before? For that matter, how do you add a practice to your life (exercising, eating healthy, meditating, waking up early, whatever) through 'deciding to do so' alone?

That [aforementioned](https://betterexplained.com/articles/life-lessons-10-years/) BetterExplained blog post (highly recommended for the aspirational) mentions a good concept, the Men's Health Problem: 

> In theory, you should read one magazine and become superhuman. Yet somehow there's hundreds of issues, over years, detailing the same goal. Either the tips don't work, or the problem is with applying the tips, not getting more of them. (Issue 1: Here's 10 essential tips. Issue 2: Did you read and apply issue 1?)

It seems obvious once you hear it, and it's a familiar idea -- but I really like the bundled-up-under-a-term version, The Men's Health Problem. (Actually I really like that for lots of things, and am constantly learning new ones and forgetting them. It's useful to think in higher-level abstractions, and finding higher level abstractions is a consistently good way to gain understanding about the world. I'm pretty sure I'm going to eventually want to start keeping a list of capital-C Concepts, which are "abstract ideas about life experience, wrapped up under evocative names", so I'm now decided to keep calling these Concepts, and now I'm going to start an Anki deck of them so they don't escape from memory even if they are rarely invoked.)

Equivalently, you can decide to start doing something or change your behavior in some way, but that's only barely similar to actually doing it. You can decide on New Year's Eve that you're going to bike to work on every day in the new year, and then wake up the next day and just not do it. So what does that make of your action on New Year's Eve? Can that even be called "deciding"? Human statements of form "I will X" are actually statements "I want to do X", and observers should only believe you if your track record of "doing things you want to do" is good. (And if your "wanting to do things you *say* you want to do" track record is good, also). *You* should only believe yourself according to that rule, also. It's just very easy to say you're going to do something different and very easy not to do it, and most people (anecdotally: me) only do mentally easy things, most of the time.

As far as I've seen, the way to change your behavior 'for real' is to make the new behavior easy. This is easy in the sense of "doesn't require concerted and continuous force of will to implement" -- invoking the idea of willpower being a [finite resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion), which [probably](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html) isn't that accurate, but it feels *related* to the truth. What's definitely relateable of it is that things that are hard to get yourself to do *usually don't happen*, so if you want to do something, especially consistent, you should make it *easy*.

I know of four ways to do this:

1. Sign up for it, because "showing up for something you're signed up for" is usually easy. This is the benefit of exercising with a buddy, or those New Year's exercise classes for new people that promise to take you through the basics of whatever you're trying to do.

2. Train enough to just make it easy. I only managed to incorporate regularly cooking meals into my life when I got past the baseline education so that I approximately felt like I knew how to cook something for myself when I wanted to. (Sign-up-and-show-up is often a good tactic to get to this point: classes until it's mentally easy to continue. But good, say, YouTube tutorials may also suffice.)

3. Change your lower-level filters on behavior. By lower-level, I mean subconscious -- for instance, if you start finding processed food gross, you're going to eat less of it, and if you can make this happen on purpose it's a very effective way of changing habits. For this method, carefully analyzing the world around you and the way your body feels is the best way to get it to work. 
 I finally learned (many years later than I wish I had) to associate a certain miserable "sludgey" feeling with not getting exercise, which made exercising easy to sustain. I've also found that just learning to *identify* ill-fitted clothing caused me to dress vastly better (helping fix an ongoing self-consciousness), and just learning to identify bad posture has caused my posture to trend upwards over the years with zero 'willpower expenditure'.

4. Change your identity into a "person who does X", for whom doing X is easy.

That last one is a little different, and that's the one I'm trying to figure out and apply to blogging here. This is what it feels like for me:

Observe that the resolution to "go to the gym 3x a week", or whatever, is equivalent (or perhaps 'actually') a commitment to "henceforth be a person who goes to the gym 3x a week". That means being a person who *picks the gym over other things*, and who *automatically fits it into their schedule*, as though it's important to them. 

I suspect that this is a useful model: that people hold in their minds a model of their identity, "who they are", which comes packaged with "what kinds of things a person like me does". And if your mental model of your identity doesn't include "fitness person" in your personal description bullet-point list, then you're going to struggle infinitely to incorporate fitness into your life. So adding habits to your life may require editing your identity slightly.

Anecdotally, I managed to incorporate bike commuting into my life in this way. I tried to start commuting by bike for maybe a year before getting it to stick, and when it stuck it was because one summer I (felt like) I embraced the "I am a person who bikes everywhere" mindset, whereas previously it was a thing I only liked the idea of doing, and whenever it became hard I would take the bus.

There's a lot of 'inertia' to your identity, both in your own head and due to social forces. You project yourself externally based on the kind of person you're comfortable being (and 'acting like'). There's no reason it would be easy to suddenly start acting like a new kind of person on your own, after months or years of acting a particular way. Much less if you have to deal with the reactions of people who knew the 'old you'. It's not impossible, though, and it's probably easier if your identity includes "prone to shifting" as a characteristic.

It's therefore easier to change identities at boundaries in your social life, because with new people you get a free pass to project differently. These include moving to new places, starting new jobs, attending new schools, or changing relationships or friend groups.

It's not particularly easy to change habits via changing identities at New Years, because there's nothing transitionary about that period in your social life. Unless, I suppose, all your acquaintances are trying to transition habits also (in which case maybe "we're all transitioning habits!" becomes a social thing, and helps reinforce everyone's new identities, which seems great.) But New Years can still help with habit formation via the first two methods.



### Addendum

(This part isn't really related to habits, and probably should be a separate post.)

Incidentally, I suspect the model that behaviors are pegged in internalized identities goes a lot further than habits. I think it's where a lot of personality traits come from -- because a person learns 'one way to act' that's comfortable to them, a pallet of behaviors, and nothing drives them to learn a new one. (This pallet can include behaviors that resist changing the pallet, like getting aggresive in response to criticism.) 

Other types of actions that I suspect are only in *some* peoples' pallets include:

* thinking that getting a job in a new city is an option for you (acquired by getting to know people who 'do things like that', and leads to 'not being stuck in your hometown' either mentally or practically)
* thinking that backpacking across Europe, or Asia, or getting a job at a farm in Hawaii for 6 months, or whatnot is an option for you (also acquired by getting to know people who 'do things like that', and leads to 'doing things like that')
* having a kneejerk strong-No reaction to abuse in relationships (probably acquired by learning it from parents or mentors, and leads to escaping/not finding oneself in abusive relationships)
* being comfortable/confident leaving situations causing overwhelming stress or depression (cities, jobs, whatever)
* (for men) knowing a way of interacting with women that isn't misogynistic. 

I know that for me, when I used to suffer from depression pretty badly, a saving grace was convincing myself that "running away from this life *is* an option" (which would have amounted to dropping out or transferring out of college). Since then, when I've had friends going through rough times, I've tried to make sure they know that "if you need to flee your life, I'll hlep you", and make that *seem pallatable* as an option, because it is but it's hard to 'feel' it as within your ability. I don't know if I succeeded in, like, 'convincing their identity' that it's a choice, or if it ended up mattering, but I still think it's a decent idea to try.

I suspect that for many activist causes, a decent concrete contribution is to "make sure people know of things they can do", or rather, "add things to people's pallets of behaviors", such that they feel as though they can *actually do* those things if they need to. This is helpful both in avoiding the feeling of being trapped in a situation (which can multiply stress / misery) and in actually leading to those options (such as getting help, running away, etc). 

This is why disseminating information about suicide hotlines is super important. This is also, I suspect, why the you know the phrase "we don't negotiate with terrorists" -- because, even if the government *does* negotiate with terrorists, it's important that the average terrorist/hostage-taker/whatever doesn't think that bargaining/ransoms/hostage-taking is an option for them, and making sure everyone knows that policy is the way to do that.

I want to blog every day, now, as promised. I also already wanted to 'work' every day, and I've felt that way for at least a year (probably more like 8). It never sticks, because doing that *isn't me* -- in a sense. But in what sense? Can it be changed?

<!--more-->

(Digression: keeping with the overwrought-yet-satisfying analogy to wizardry, when I say I want to 'work' every day, I mean I want to 'study and master ancient tomes of forbidden lore'. And by 'forbidden lore' I mean 'anything Interesting', and that's a capital I to refer to this specific kind of interesting that I find, er, addictive -- the quality of *alluding to the secret nature of the universe*. The history of, say, a WWII battle is interesting but not *Interesting*, because it doesn't seem to reveal universal truth. A WWII battle *can* allude to the secret nature of the universe, if what happens hints at some universe truth of human nature, or causality, or intuition, or inevitability, or something like that. Artistic or dramatic revelations count. But it doesn't necessarily do this. Neither does any part of math, per se, but many parts do, and I would like to learn them all.)

### How not to forcibly implement a habit

Confession: I didn't blog every day. I failed by day 3. At least three reasons:

* For the first 2.5 days, I did successfully a "this is what I do now" feeling to working on writing. I'm familiar with this (more later). It was gone by the end of day 3.
* I became quite sick on day 3 and that severely dampered my ability to keep working. The illness has been on and off for a week but it's wrong to say that it has totally prevented work on this. I could've been back to work after a couple of days.
* The actual reason for stopping: the thing I tried to write about on Day 3 wasn't as fully-formed as the first two, but I didn't want to skip it to get to more fully-formed ideas. I stared at it and typed lots of things I didn't like and gave up.

**Unsurprising lesson: plans tend to fall apart when they get hard**. But this is a failure of the plan -- the system for getting the habit to stick. Can we do better?

I've spent lots of time this week thinking about things that are writeable, and I am/was already convinced that this blogging experiment is going to consist of brain-dumping each interesting idea as an approximately coherent form, at least until I get better at crafting them into essays. It's suddenly clear that it's not going to work to pick a plan for what to write about ahead of time and make myself do it the day of -- it just won't happen. A better approach will be: waiting until I get deep into thinking about something and then writing that down, whatever it is. Phrased as a lesson, that's **Lesson: do what your brain feels like, not what you want it to do** (you can try to change what your brain feels like doing -- but that's a *separate task*.)

It's not possible to implement that as "each day, wait until a good idea comes about, then write about it". Daily work requires being ahead of the daily schedule on output, because there will always be bad (or sick) days. I'm confident I have more than one writeable (by my standards, not yours!) idea per day, on average, so the way to succeed at this is to rapidly collect half-finished ideas when I'm free and my mind seems to be working correctly, and then work through publishing those at the one-per-day rate afterwards. **Lesson: you have to be way ahead of a schedule to keep it, if the work requires luck**. Obvious in hindsight. (Obvious in foresight too, but the trick is framing it onto your situation, not realizing it abstractly.) Concrete implication: the average good day should be publishing one post, but working on two, three, or five. That will let bad days be harmless.

It also has to be okay to *fail*. To miss days from lacking will to work, or from trying to work but drawing a blank on the material. It's good to set yourself personal accountability systems, but it's necessary to calibrate how you feel about breaking them. The emotional reaction needs to be enough to prevent you from failing if it's relatively easy not to fail, while not being so much that failure leads to a whirlwind of stress. I also prefer the mindset that no work is better than low-quality work, and is better than work you're not happy with. The lesson: **pick how you feel about failure carefully. You *do* get to pick; it's your system.** Pick such that you will both survive failures and still want to avoid them.

It's also fine to change the system. I suspect I'll eventually uncommit to posting every day and keep it at something like every weekday. Better to change a system than keep floundering in an untenable one.

In order to keep doing something like this, which involves this mental process of 'projecting yourself outward and swallowing your self-consciousness', it's important to be continuously okay with what you've created. I find that guilt or shame destroys the willpower to continue with creative tasks. (The wildest artistic abandon probably requires a total absence of shame. Or a well-honed ability to totally ignore it). As such it is important to let yourself correct anything you're self-conscious about, after the fact, if doing so is easy. In my case that's liberally editing posts when they start to bother me. **Let yourself do things that make abiding your system easier.** (I noticed this was important when I saw it on BetterExplained's [retrospective](https://betterexplained.com/articles/life-lessons-10-years/)).

Incidentally, I've observed that the 'this is awkward' circuits, which normally fire when reading other people's writing, are disabled when reading my own for a few days after the writing, but reengage after that. So re-reading several days later gives a very different perspective. This adds some points to the "be okay with editing your own stuff after publishing" column, but adds a lot more to the "write everything early so you have time to rework it before publishing" one.

### Habits as Identities

How do you start doing something every day you didn't do at all before? Is there any effective way to up and change you life through 'deciding to do so' alone?

The [aforementioned](https://betterexplained.com/articles/life-lessons-10-years/) BetterExplained blog post (highly recommended for the aspirational) mentions a good concept, the Men's Health Problem: 

> In theory, you should read one magazine and become superhuman. Yet somehow there's hundreds of issues, over years, detailing the same goal. Either the tips don't work, or the problem is with applying the tips, not getting more of them. (Issue 1: Here's 10 essential tips. Issue 2: Did you read and apply issue 1?)

It seems obvious once you hear it, and it's a familiar idea -- but I really like the bundled-up-under-a-term version, "The Men's Health Problem". That's useful. 

(I really like that for lots of things. I'm constantly learning new bundled-and-tagged concepts but tend to later forget them. They're useful because they give you higher-level abstractions to 'think ith', and working in higher-level abstractions is a consistently good way to make more sense of the world. I'm pretty sure I'm going to eventually want to start keeping a list of such concepts, which are "abstract ideas about life experience, wrapped up under evocative names", so I'm now decided to keep calling these capital-C Concepts, and now I'm going to start an Anki deck of them so they don't escape from memory even if they are rarely invoked.)

Equivalently, you can decide to start doing something or change your behavior in some way, but that's only barely similar to actually doing it. You can decide on New Year's Eve (or a birthday, or whatever) that you're going to bike to work every day in the new year, and then wake up the next day and just... not do it. So what does that make of your action on New Year's Eve? Can that even be called "deciding"? Human statements of form "I will X" are actually statements "I want to do X", and observers should only believe you if your track record of "doing things you want to do" is good. (And if your "actually wanting to do things you *say* you want to do" track record is good, also). *You* should only believe yourself according to that rule, also. It's just very easy to say you're going to do something different and very easy not to do it, and most people (anecdotally: me) only do mentally easy things, most of the time.

The effective way of changing your behavior 'for real' seems to be by making the new behavior easy. That's easy in the sense of "doesn't require concerted and continuous force of will to implement" -- invoking the idea of willpower being a [finite resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion), which [probably](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html) isn't that realistic, but it feels at least *related* to the truth. What's definitely familiaris that things that are hard to get yourself to do usually don't happen, so if you want to do something, especially consistent, you should make it *easy*.

I know of four ways to do make something easy:

1. Sign up for it, because "showing up for something you're signed up for" is usually easy. This is the benefit of exercising with a buddy, or those New Year's exercise classes for new people that promise to take you through the basics of whatever you're trying to do.

2. Train enough to actually just make it easy. I only managed to incorporate regularly cooking meals into my life when I got past the baseline education so that I approximately felt like I knew how to cook something for myself when I wanted to. (Sign-up-and-show-up is good for you getting to this point: classes until it's mentally easy to continue, then it'll just happen naturally.)

3. Change your lower-level filters on the behavior so not doing it is hard. For instance, one way to stop eating processed food is to start *finding it gross*. If you can make this happen on purpose it's a very effective way of changing a habit. I don't know a surefire way to modify your reactions to things, but I've noticed that learning new knowledge that lets you look at the world more discriminatingly can induce it for free.
 Examples: I finally learned (many years later than I wish I had) to associate a certain miserable "sludgey" feeling with not getting exercise, which made exercising easy to sustain. I've found that learning to identify ill-fitted clothing caused me, over time, to dress vastly better (helping fix an ongoing source of self-consciousness), and that just learning to identify bad posture has caused my posture improve over the years, with zero 'willpower effort'.

4. Change your identity into a "person who does X", for whom doing X is easy.

That last one is a little different, and that's the one I'm trying to figure out and apply to blogging here. This is what it feels like for me:

Observe that the resolution to "go to the gym 3x a week this year", or whatever, feels more like a commitment to "henceforth be a person who goes to the gym 3x a week". That means being a person who *picks the gym over other things*, and who *goes by default, without thinking*, and who *by default fits it into their schedule*, as though it's important to them. This isn't quite what you're signing up for when you just resolve to go to the gym, but it's what you actually need to be doing to make the new habit work.

I suspect that this is a useful model: that people hold in their minds a model of their identity, "who they are", which comes packaged with "what kinds of things a person like me does". And if your mental model of your identity doesn't include "fitness person" in your personal description bullet-point list, then you're going to struggle infinitely to incorporate fitness into your life. So adding habits to your life may require editing your identity slightly.

Anecdotally, I managed to incorporate bike commuting into my life in this way. I tried to start commuting by bike for maybe a year before getting it to stick, and when it stuck it was because one summer I embraced the "I am a person who bikes everywhere" mindset, whereas previously it was a thing I only liked the idea of doing, and whenever it became hard I would take the bus.

There's a lot of inertia to your identity, both in your own head and due to social forces. You project yourself externally based on the kind of person you're comfortable being (and 'acting like'). There's no reason it would be easy to suddenly start acting like a new kind of person on your own, after months or years of acting a particular way. Much less if you have to deal with the reactions of people who knew the 'old you'. It's not impossible, though, and it's probably easier if your identity includes "prone to shifting" as a characteristic (similar it's totally normal for some people to dye their hair but very surprising when others do it).

It's therefore easier to change identities at transitions in your social life, because with new people you get a free pass to project a different identity outwards. These include moving to new places, starting new jobs, attending new schools, or changing relationships or friend groups.

Conversely, it's not particularly easy to change habits via changing identities at New Years or after a birthday, because there's no accompanying transition in your social life. Unless, I suppose, all your acquaintances are trying to transition habits also (in which case maybe "we're all transitioning habits!" becomes a social thing, and helps reinforce everyone's new identities, which seems great.) But new years can still help with habit formation by motivating you to implement the other methods.

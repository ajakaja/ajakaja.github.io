React.js, that is.

I wanted to write some posts about React: why it's great, why hooks are great, and then maybe what all is wrong with it and what can be done.

## 1

In the beginning there was HTML:

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <div class="specialButton" onclick="doSomething()">Click me</div>
        <div class="label">Do it</div>
    </body>
</html>
```

HTML has a certain elegance to it (except for that `doSomething()` bit), which is that you pretty much write exactly what you want to see on the page. The syntax is cludgy, and the output looks like crap by default, but it's what you asked for: in this case, a document which contains a button and a label. 

HTML is wonderfully direct because it's a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) language. Critically, there is no step in which plain HTML code is interpreted into arbitrary functions and loops and whatnot, in which it would get to do anything under the sun. It's a tradeoff, of course: is it better to use a more expressive language, or to use a simple one that does what it says, but then have to build a whole ecosystem in other languages around it? Well, it doesn't matter, because in 2022 we're stuck with this for the foreseeable future.

By the way, HTML did not need to have an XML-based syntax to be declarative. We could just as easily have built the whole web on a language that uses a function-call syntax based on Javascript:

```js
html(
    body(
        div("Click me", class="specialButton", onclick="doSomething()", 
        div("Do it", class="label")
    )
)
```

Alternatively we could have used something like... JSON:

```js
document = {
    type: "html",
    children: [{
        type: "body", 
        children: [
            {type: "div", class: "specialButton", onclick: doSomething, children=["Click me"]},
            {type: "div", class: "label", children: ["Do it"]},
        ]
    }]
}
```

Although it's a bit awkward. How about Lisp:

```lisp
(html 
    (body
        (div (class "specialButton") (onclick "doSomething()") "Click me")
        (div (class "label") "Do it")
    )
)
```

Or whatever. It's all the same if you limit the syntax appropriately and it interprets to the same result. If history had gone a bit differently, we could have been using any of these.

The XML syntax doesn't limit you to declarative programming, either. You can implement control-flow in XML: just create tags like `<if>` and `<else>`. You can just define the entire syntax tree as XML entities [like Java's ANT did](https://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html).

So HTML is beautifully simple because it is declarative, in that it describes the logical layout of the page and the browser goes and figures out how to build it, and because nobody has bolted declarative control flow onto it directly. Which would be fine, except for one major problem that was never really solved: _abstraction_.

The thing HTML didn't have and always needed was the ability to define custom nodes that expanded into trees of nodes, while keeping the declarative style. The imperative example above begs to support defining new functions: `specialButton = () => div("Click me", onclick="doSomething")`. It's still just a representation of data: just, you can make up a word for a chunk of data and use it again and again if you want to. But no, HTML doesn't do that.

Of course an imperative language without function definitions would be absurd. But for some reason when you use an XML syntax everyone forgets that the ability to abstract --- to factor a chunk of logic out into a named instruction --- is critical. Even in full-fledged XML you only define tags in separate "schema" definitions, not inline with the actual code you're writing.

From the beginning HTML's use for complex development was strangled by its lack of support for abstraction. A bunch of things were tried:

**1. CSS**: CSS is a glued-on way of implementing abstraction in HTML, only for `style` attributes. Two divs with the same `specialDiv` classname have something in common: they're both 'inheriting' some shared style information a sort of mixin inheritance. It's powerful for what it does, but when you view it as an attempt at way of solving "abstraction in HTML", it's far from adequate.

**2. Server-side templating**: Server-side HTML document construction used to be the bread-and-butter of web-development. Run some SQL queries, iterate over the output, create HTML corresponding to each thing you read (accidentally parse a bunch of user data and let it run arbitrary code), ... 

In a language like PHP, since you were _generating_ HTML instead of just writing it verbatim, you could freely use PHP's ability to abstract to invoke functions inside of the HTML generation. Great, but limited to the server-side, so it doesn't solve dynamically updating in the browser.

**3. Imperative UI**: Why write 

```html
<div class="specialButton" onclick="doSomething()">Click me</div>
```

when you can write 

```js
$("<div>").attr('class', 'specialButton').click(doSomething)
```

Well, if you have ever worked on an app built this way, you already know the answer: because when you do it that way it becomes total illegible shit. 

**4. Templates**: Did you know that every major browser supports [HTML Templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template)? They look like this:

```html
<template id="specialbutton">
    <div class="specialbutton" onClick="doSomething()">Click me</div>
</template>
```

Unfortunately, to use them, you have to clone, modify, and insert them from JS. A nice idea but in practice, a total pain.

Look at them all: these feeble attempts at adding abstraction to HTML. We were floundering and suffering... and then along came React with JSX and let us do this:

```jsx
const SpecialButton = ({onClick}) => {
    return <div class="specialButton" onClick={onClick}>Click me</div>;
}
```

Yes, we have to start writing our UI in JS. But that (a) was always going to be necessary and (b) doesn't mean it's not declarative. It's just a syntax. Declarative is, as discussed above, ultimately about whether you are directly writing out the data you want to use. It doesn't matter if the language _also_ supports imperative styles, if you're not using them (although that option certainly makes more kinds of mistakes possible).

(Aside: most browsers now also support something called [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) which lets you define new HTML tags in JS. It's clearly inspired by React; they even have React-style lifecycle methods! But it's probably too late. React has already moved on from class components for good reason. But maybe there's a future there?)

The Zen of React is that you just write down what you want to see on the page. (The non-Zen side of React is how much munging it takes to make it work afterwards. At least it's _partly_ zen.)

Want to scaffold out a new website but you don't know anything about what it looks like yet? Eh, just start writing out the component structure and figure it out as you go:

```jsx
const App = () => (
    <UI>
        <Header />
        <Sidebar />
        <Content />
        <Footer />
    </UI>
);
```

Want to define a new component that's a button with a label, so that every button on your site is an instance of the same components that work and style the same way? Go for it:

```jsx
const ButtonWithLabel = ({id, onClick, label}) => (
    <div>
        <div class="button" role="button" onclick={onclick}/>
        <div class="label">{label}</div>
    </div>;
);
```

Want to make a modal that pops out of a widget and overlays the whole page but still bubbles events to its parents? Heck, sure, and unlike every previous way to do this, it's (basically) declarative, even though it involves components popping out of the DOM in front of other widgets:

```jsx
const WidgetWithModal = () => {
    const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = React.useState(false);

    return 
        (<div>
            <div>Blah blah blah</div>
            <div class="button" onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Click me</div>
            {modalOpen && 
                (<Modal onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}>
                    <div>I'm in a modal!</div>
                    <div class="button" onClick={() => setModalOpen(false)}>Close me</div>
                </Modal>)
            }
        </div>);
}

const Modal = ({onClose, children}) => {
    // a bit awkward
    const container = React.useMemo(() => document.querySelector(".modal-container"), []);

    // render a gray overlay over the whole page, then put the modal contents on top of it.
    // no one knows why the syntax for this isn't <Portal> but hey you can implment that if you want.
    return React.createPortal(
        (
            <div class="overlay" onClick={onClose}>
                <div class="modal-body">
                    {children}
                </div>
            </div>
        ), container);
}
```

It is really so great. 

Don't get me wrong: it's not perfect. Far from it. There are rough edges everywhere , and writing clean and bug-free code is still hard and often requires actual expertise to get right.

But it's so much closer to what development should feel like, compared to what came before, that it's fantastic. And the more it evolves to deliver on its promise, the further down the path to zen programming nirvana we get. (Hopefully one day there is no HTML anymore and JSX is directly rendered by browsers. Just saying.) It dramatically expands the scope of "what can be done declaratively", which is what we needed the whole time even if we apparently we didn't realize it.

Of course there is lots of tricky business that goes into massaging it into exactly what you wanted and working around weird limitations and of course handling state. But to even be able to _write it out in the first place_ -- that was the big innovation of React.

## Appendix: the zen parts

JSX is zen. Writing exactly what you want to see and then adding details later is zen. Clean abstractions that let you keep doing that are also zen.

If you care to hear some opinions, here are some other things that are zen:

1. Function components
2. Hooks, most of the time
5. Contexts
7. Portals
3. View-only components with no state
4. Logic-only components with no views
5. Components with no UI at all that just give definite lifecycles to other things, like Redux stores or network clients or caches.
9. Component libraries
10. Design systems which abstract out and 'solve' common functionality like buttons, menus, and modals.
11. Inline styles, especially for non-inherited concepts
12. Error boundaries
13. Async components with `<Suspense>`
14. Hiding things with `style={{'{{display: "none"'}}}}` instead of unmounting them, if they're conceptually invisible instead of gone.
15. Unit testing with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
16. Hydration, in principle

And here are some things that are currently not zen. Not all of those are React's fault. Some if it is just how browsers work and some of it is historical baggage. Nevertheless:

1. Class components
5. Redux
3. Iframes
4. Animations / Transitions
12. HOCs
13. Smooth user interaction, such as draggable elements
8. Keybindings
9. Focus and focus-locking
10. Handling tab ordering and screen-reader ordering
19. Z-indexes
17. SVG, Canvas, MathML, and WebGL
12. [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver)
12. Refs in general
11. But especially `useImperativeHandle`
16. Cross-app interactions, such as a button in a sidebar controlling the main view.
7. The syntax for Portals
8. Having to implement `ErrorBoundary` class components.
14. Chasing down React component errors once ErrorBoundary catches them
18. Figuring out what is re-rendering and why
15. Inspecting and modifying props in Devtools
9. Actually pretty much all debugging.
20. Unit testing with Enzyme
21. Hydration, in practice

Yup. More on all this later.

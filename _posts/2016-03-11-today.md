Ahem. Hi there,

I'm Alex and this is my blog.

I'm thinking about writing down some:

* Opinions on things
* Somewhat-original research or summarizing articles on math, computer science, physics, and related fields
* Caches and outlines of subjects I've learned
* Things I've figured out that might be useful to other people
* Links to things I've worked on
